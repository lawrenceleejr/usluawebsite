For the 10th anniversary of the Higgs discovery the US LHC Users Association (USLUA) will be joining together with US-CMS and US-ATLAS and the US HEP community in general along with distinguished guests, to celebrate this milestone in the history of science.

Please see [https://indico.slac.stanford.edu/event/7272/timetable/](https://indico.slac.stanford.edu/event/7272/timetable/) for the agenda for the celebration on

**June 30  -- 19:00 CERN time/10AM Pacific/ Noon Central/ 1 PM Eastern.**

This is during the CMS Week at CERN, and given the excellent progress of the LHC commissioning and preparations of the experiments, we expect to be close to the first days of the Run3 (2022-2025) data taking at 13.6 TeV.

The program includes a keynote address by Prof. Joseph Incandela, Vice Chancellor for Research at UCSB. As then-spokesperson of CMS, Incandela presented the CMS results, along with now-CERN Director Fabiola Gianotti who presented the ATLAS results, that were the basis of the Higgs boson discovery announced on July 4, 2012.
