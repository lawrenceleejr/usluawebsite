**_**FBAR - extension of the deadline for disclosure of foreign bank accounts to October 15**  
  
See this NY Times article on the extension of the deadline for  
the voluntary disclosure program to October 15. This also thus extends  
the deadline for back-filing of FBAR forms without penalty (the lack of  
penalty only applies if all taxes were already properly paid on the  
foreign accounts).

**_**News from the CERN Directorate following the Users' Survey**  
  

  Here is some news from the CERN Directorate about actions  
  following the survey:  
   
  1.  You will be able to book the hostel online starting  
        December 2009. 
      It will enable users to:  
      - make individual booking up to 48h before arrival  
      - cancel booking (modification possible only via the  
        reception desk)  
      - guarantee reservation with a credit card  
   
  2. A list of hotels close to CERN with their negotiated  
     rate will be available from the Housing/Hostel webpage  
     very soon (perhaps late September)  
   
  3. A new Corporate rate with Hertz from GVA Airport.  
     [http://www.genevaairport.net/Car-Hire/Avis-Hertz-Desk.php](http://www.genevaairport.net/Car-Hire/Avis-Hertz-Desk.php)  
     (corporate rates will be attributed while presenting  
     CERN card). World-wide corporate rates in negotiation.  
   
  4. Construction is planned for an expansion of  
     Restaurant 1, and drawings are available at:  
  [http://www.perret.ch/cernrestaurant1/Projet/Archives/Version%20du%2013.07.2009/Low-res/](http://www.perret.ch/cernrestaurant1/Projet/Archives/Version%20du%2013.07.2009/Low-res/)  
   
    -  Renovation work (½ terrasse).  In October and  
         November 2009  
    -    Construction work between April and October 2010  
   
  5. New Map with conference rooms available at CERN.  
  [http://gs-dep.web.cern.ch/gs-dep/groups/SEM/ce/isp/conf\_rooms/conf\_rooms.html](http://gs-dep.web.cern.ch/gs-dep/groups/SEM/ce/isp/conf_rooms/conf_rooms.html)  
   
  6. A brochure for newcomers will be available in 2010. 
   
  7. Evaluation of stable Wifi on all site.  
    A number of studies have been carried out recently on the  
  possibility to deploy wireless everywhere at CERN. The outcome of  
  these studies demonstrate that not only would it require several  
  millions CHF to implement a global coverage but more importantly that   
  the current technologies are not capable of answering the requirement  
  at locations where the population is dense. The service quality  
  offered by the wired infrastructure in offices, recently upgraded, is  
  in any case far better that what wireless could provide. An awareness  
  campaign has started: an article will be published in the next CERN  
  Computer Newsletter, and a new WEB site has been built  
  ([http://cern.ch/wireless).](http://cern.ch/wireless%29.) The lack of adequate number of network  
  connections at some locations can easily be solved by the use of  
  FANOUTs, available from the CERN stores, which allow the connection of  
  several computers on the same socket.  
   
  IT has concentrated its efforts in regularly deploying and improving  
  the wireless coverage in open areas (meeting rooms, restaurants,  
  lobby, etc) and is also deploying more recent and more powerful base  
  stations in building 4, 32, 40, 60, in restaurant #1, in the council  
  chamber, in the main amphitheatre and in the experiments control rooms  
  by first quarter 2010.

**_**News from the CERN Council**

This week’s Council meetings provided the opportunity for Council to be brought up to date on the continuing consolidation work on the LHC. The members noted with pleasure the good progress towards the restart in mid-November.

The meetings saw a number of firsts. Council saw the first presentation of a White Paper on the scientific and geographical enlargement of CERN. The White Paper makes clear recommendations to Council aimed at consolidating CERN’s position as a key player on the global particle physics stage. The Council's deliberations continue and the issues of scientific and geographical enlargement will be considered again at its next meeting. The number of candidates for membership also grew this week, following the formal application of the Republic of Slovenia, whose candidature joins those of Cyprus, Israel, Serbia and Turkey. All these applications will be discussed in December.

Discussions on the status of the Pension Fund began during the week. These discussions will continue in more depth at the Council meetings in December.   

We were glad this week to welcome Robert Jan Smits, Director of the European Research Area: research programmes and capacity directorate of the EU’s Research Directorate General. This is the first Council session at which the EU has participated since the signature of the recent Memorandum of Understanding between CERN and the EU, and we’re looking forward to developing a fruitful partnership at the heart of European science.

Council heard a report on the activities of ECFA, including the important reviews of particle physics related activities in member countries. Council also endorsed the submission of an FP7 proposal for a new Preparatory Phase Project related to the European Strategy for Particle Physics.  

Last but not least, the European Strategy Session of Council heard reports on knowledge and technology transfer, and communication, reflecting the increasing importance attached to these activities by Council.

Further details of all the week’s meetings will soon be available on the web at:

**_**Updated Tax Information**Following the town meeting that took place in Vaud on August 31 2009 with experts on US taxes for US citizens and green card holders living in Switzerland, the experts provided two files giving a summary of the issues and tax obligations. These can be accessed at the US LUO website at **[www.usluo.org](http://www.usluo.org/)**  
  
The files were accompanied by the following statement:  
  
_"This compilation was put together by our member, Susan Stuber, based on these two tax information meetings as well as interviews and correspondence with, chiefly, Geoffrey DeHaven.  It is meant as a guideline to your most pressing questions; if you desire further information, there are footnotes to guide you to the relevant web links.  At the end of the day, however, you will be well-advised to have a tax advisor who is versed in U.S. tax regulation."  
_  
Note that some of the information relates to the FBAR report on foreign bank accounts that  
(for those obligated to file) has to reach the IRS by Sept. 23.

**_**Important reminder for USLUO members living abroad - US Tax Information**  
(1) The Foreign Bank Account Report (FBAR). **If you have a foreign bank account  
      and at any time the balance went above $ 10,000 you are obligated to file  
      the FBAR form. It needs to reach the IRS (not just to be postmarked)  
      no later than Wednesday, September 23.** The original deadline for 2008 was  
      June 30, 2009 but an extension may be granted if you include a suitably apologetic  
      letter explaining why it is late. You have to file one form for every tax year. Failure to  
      file may incur a penalty of up to $ 10,000, if the IRS decides to impose the penalty.  
  
     _**If you are sure that the balance never went above $ 10,000 you need not file.**_  
  
(2) Following the recent town hall meetings, one of the tax experts posted the answers to  
      a series of questions that attendees submitted. Some of the answers may be surprising,  
      especially for US citizens or couples where one spouse is a US citizen, with a permanent  
      residence or other assets abroad. So please have a look if you may be affected.

Important US Tax Information for USLUO Members  
  
**_

Please note the following important notices from Katie Yurkewicz and Tami Kramer, who attended two town hall meetings where expert information was provided.  
  
An urgent matter is the Report on Foreign Bank Accounts, which has a hard-deadline due date of  
September 23. 
  
Thanks to Tami and Katie for attending and for gathering this information for our community.  
  
Best regards  
 Harvey  
   

Greetings,

  

As was announced several weeks ago, two town hall meetings took place recently near CERN on the subject of US tax issues for Americans abroad. A podcast of one of the meetings, held on August 31 in Lully, Vaud, is available online:

  

[http://vaud.democrats.ch/labels/Vaud%20US%20taxes%20event.html](http://vaud.democrats.ch/labels/Vaud%20US%20taxes%20event.html)

  

A list of speakers and powerpoint presentation from one of the speakers is also available at the same link.

  

One of the biggest subjects of discussion at the meeting was the upcoming SEPTEMBER 23 deadline for filing copies of the FBAR for past years without penalty. The FBAR, or Report of Foreign Bank Accounts, must be filed by all United States persons if they meet the criteria set by the Department of The Treasury. More information on the FBAR can be found at this page:

[http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=210247,00.html?portlet=6](http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=210247,00.html?portlet=6)

  

According to the IRS’ Web site (link below),

  

“Taxpayers who reported and paid tax on all their 2008 taxable income, but only recently learned of their FBAR filing obligation and have insufficient time to gather the necessary information to complete the FBAR, should file the delinquent FBAR report according to the instructions and attach a statement explaining why the report is filed late.”

  

The deadline for filing without penalty is September 23, 2009. Instructions are at the following link:

[http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=210174,00.html](http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=210174,00.html)

  

Much more information for U.S. persons residing abroad can be found at the IRS’ Web site for International Taxpayers:

Option for a media training session just prior to annual meeting  
  
**_We have the option for a media training session from 3:30 - 5:00 PM  
on Friday Sept. 25. 
  
The purpose of the session is to train members of our community in  
how to better deal with the media, and the public. A case in point is  
the annual visits to Congress. The right approach is needed to  
"communicate"  
our science and our issues well.  
  
These sessions, by experts in the subject, have been judged to be very  
useful by those who have attended.  
  
Because this valuable option was raised rather late (our apologies),  
whether it takes  
place or not depends on whether we will have a sufficient set of attendees.  
So if you would like to attend please let Katie and me know.  
  
Note that this session would be particularly valuable for anyone  
thinking of attending  
the annual trip to Washington DC in the Spring.

**_**FYI #110: Outlook on Appropriations Bills**  

FYI  
The American Institute of Physics Bulletin of Science Policy News  
Number 110: September 2, 2009  
Web version: [http://www.aip.org/fyi/2009/110.html](http://www.aip.org/fyi/2009/110.html)  
  
Outlook on FY 2010 Appropriations Bills  
  
When Congress returns to Washington next week it will have much on  
its plate: a health care reform bill, climate change legislation,  
and a financial services regulation bill.  At the top of Congress'  
must-do list will be passage of twelve appropriations bills to fund  
the operations of the federal government beginning on October 1. 
  
Congress is much further along in the appropriations cycle than it  
was last year at this time.  The House Appropriations Committee  
completed all twelve of its bills and secured their passage on the  
House floor.  The Senate Appropriations Committee completed eleven  
bills, needing only to write its version of the FY 2010 Defense  
bill.  Only five of the committee's eleven bills have been passed on  
the floor, and the outlook for speedy passage of the rest is  
uncertain because Senate floor procedures favor longer debate.  
  
Failure to enact any of the appropriations bills will require a  
short term funding bill called a continuing resolution.  These  
resolutions generally maintain spending at current rates for fixed  
periods of time, and several may be needed.  If Congress is unable  
to pass any of the bills separately appropriators will combine the  
remaining bills into a single large omnibus funding bill.  
  
The following is a brief summary of the status of the appropriations  
bills of greatest interest to the physics community.  The expected  
outcome for most FY 2010 budgets is for increases of, at most, a few  
percentage points.   Additional detail is available at  
[http://www.aip.org/gov/budginfo.html](http://www.aip.org/gov/budginfo.html)  
  
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE:  
  
The House-passed bill would reduce total science and technology  
program funding by 2.3 percent, opposing the Administration's  
request for a 13.6 percent reduction (which would not continue  
funding for earmarked projects.)  The House also opposed a requested  
2.4 percent cut in the FY 2010 budget for Basic Research funding,  
voting to increase it by 4.8 percent.  
  
The Senate Appropriations Committee has not approved its version of  
this legislation.  
  
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION:  
  
There are a number of programs of interest, one of which is the Math  
and Science Partnerships for which the Administration requested flat  
funding.  Senate appropriators agreed with the Administration's  
request.  The House amended the House Appropriations Committee bill  
to include a 3 percent increase for the Partnerships, the first  
increase since FY 2006. 
  
DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY - NATIONAL NUCLEAR SECURITY ADMINISTRATION:  
  
The NNSA budget for Weapons Activities is unlikely to change much in  
FY 2010.  The Administration sought a 0.4 percent reduction.  The  
House-passed bill would make a cut of 1.4 percent.  The  
Senate-passed bill would increase the budget by 0.9 percent.  
  
DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY - OFFICE OF SCIENCE:  
  
The parameters of the final budget outcome for the Office of Science  
are in place.  The House-passed bill provided the Administration's  
requested increase of 3.9 percent.  The Senate-passed bill contains  
a 3.0 percent increase.  
  
NASA:  
  
The Senate Appropriations Committee, in a bill that has not been  
considered on the Senate floor, concurred with the Administration's  
5.1 percent requested increase.  The House approved a bill that  
would increase the agency's budget by 2.4 percent.  
  
The NASA science budget is likely to stay approximately flat.  The  
Administration asked for a 0.6 percent reduction.  The House bill  
would reduce the budget by 0.2 percent; the Senate Appropriations  
Committee bill includes a 0.3 percent reduction.  
  
NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF BIOMEDICAL IMAGING AND BIOENGINEERING:  
  
The Obama Administration requested a 1.5 increase for this unit of  
the National Institutes of Health.  The House voted for a 3.4  
percent increase, while the Senate Appropriations Committee bill  
that has not been considered on the floor would increase the budget  
by 1.7 percent.  
  
NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY:  
  
There is greater divergence in the parameters for the total NIST  
budget.  The Administration requested an increase of 3.3 percent.  
The House voted a 4.6 percent reduction.  Senate appropriators  
recommend a 7.3 percent increase.  
  
NIST's Scientific and Technical Research and Services budget stands  
out from the other budgets covered in this FYI.  The Administration  
requested a 13.3 percent increase for FY 2010.  The House-passed  
bill would increase the budget by 8.1 percent.  Senate appropriators  
recommended an increase of 10.2 percent, with a portion of this  
funding being  provided for congressionally designated projects.  
  
NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION:  
  
The Administration requested an 8.5 percent increase in the  
foundation's total budget.  The House and Senate agreed that the  
budget should be increased, although not by that much.  The House  
voted for a 6.9 percent increase; Senate appropriators for a 6.6  
percent increase.  
  
U.S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY:  
  
The Administration and Congress are in fairly close alignment on  
next year's budget for the survey.  The request was for a 5.2  
percent increase, which the House agreed to.  Senate appropriators  
would increase the budget by 5.8 percent.
