**AAAS Policy Alert (excerpts) - Budget News  
  
Congress is on recess until after the November 2 elections. Although the new fiscal year began October 1 without any FY 2011 appropriations bills having been passed by both chambers and signed by the President, the federal government is functioning under a continuing resolution (CR) extending FY 2010 funding levels for most programs until December 3.

**SBIR/STTR Programs Extended.** The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs have been extended through January 31, 2011, after the President signed [S. 3839](http://www.members-aaas.org/l.jsp?d=6196.685086.654.2a6JKES7m) on September 30, the day the programs were due to expire. The [SBIR and STTR programs](http://www.members-aaas.org/l.jsp?d=6196.685085.654.2a6JKES7m) administer grants to small businesses and small business-university partnerships for R&D activities.

**Supreme Court Hears Case on JPL Scientists and Privacy.** Last week [the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments](http://www.members-aaas.org/l.jsp?d=6196.685079.654.2a6JKES7m) on a case regarding NASA's implementation of Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12, which sets standards for issuing identification badges to all federal employees including contract employees. The [plaintiffs in the case](http://www.members-aaas.org/l.jsp?d=6196.685078.654.2a6JKES7m) involve Caltech researchers who work at the Jet Propulsion Lab and must agree to background checks even though they work on unclassified projects. The central question before the Supreme Court is whether "the government violates a federal contract employee's constitutional right to informational privacy" when it asks questions of a personal nature (e.g., illegal drug use) in the course of a background investigation. The Supreme Court's decision could have implications for many other researchers under contract to the government.

**GAO Report on COMPETES Act.** A [new report from the Government Accountability Office](http://www.members-aaas.org/l.jsp?d=6196.685072.654.2a6JKES7m) analyzed the three agencies funded by the America COMPETES Act of 2007 -- DOE's Office of Science, the National Science Foundation, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology -- and concluded that "it is too early to assess the effectiveness of these programs" (presumably, in improving U.S. competitiveness). However, the report recommended that the agencies should each "set a goal for funding high-risk, high-reward research and that \[they\] coordinate in doing so." It further recommended that the agencies include information on such research "with their annual budget requests, which are available to the public."
