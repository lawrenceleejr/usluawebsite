**_April 30, 2009_****  
Final LHC magnet goes underground**

Geneva, 30 April 2009. The 53rd and final replacement magnet for CERN’s Large Hadron Collider (LHC) was lowered into the accelerator’s tunnel today, marking the end of repair work above ground following the incident in September last year that brought LHC operations to a halt. Underground, the magnets are being interconnected, and new systems installed to prevent similar incidents happening again. The LHC is scheduled to restart in the autumn, and to run continuously until sufficient data have been accumulated for the LHC experiments to announce their first results.

_“This is an important milestone in the repair process,”_ said CERN’s Director for Accelerators and Technology, Steve Myers. _“It gets us close to where we were before the incident, and allows us to concentrate our efforts on installing the systems that will ensure a similar incident won’t happen again.”_

The final magnet, a quadrupole designed to focus the beam, was lowered this afternoon and has started its journey to Sector 3-4, scene of the September incident. With all the magnets now underground, work in the tunnel will focus on connecting the magnets together and installing new safety systems, while on the surface, teams will shift their attention to replenishing the LHC’s supply of spare magnets.

In total 53 magnets were removed from Sector 3-4. Sixteen that sustained minimal damage were refurbished and put back into the tunnel. The remaining 37 were replaced by spares and will themselves be refurbished to provide spares for the future.

_"Now we will split our team into two parts,"_ explained Lucio Rossi, Deputy head of CERN’s Technology Department. _"The main group will carry out interconnection work in the tunnel while a second will rebuild our stock of spare magnets."_

The LHC repair process can be divided into three parts. Firstly, the repair itself, which is nearing completion with the installation of the last magnet today. Secondly, systems are being installed to monitor the LHC closely and ensure that similar incidents to that of last September cannot happen again. This work will continue into the summer. Finally, extra pressure relief valves are being installed to release helium in a safe and controlled manner should there be leaks inside the LHC’s cryostat at any time in the machine’s projected 15-20 year operational lifetime.

CERN is publishing regular updates on the LHC in its internal Bulletin, available at [http://www.cern.ch/bulletin](http://www.cern.ch/bulletin), as well as via twitter and YouTube at [http://www.twitter.com/cern](http://www.twitter.com/cern) and [http://www.youtube.com/cern](http://www.youtube.com/cern)

_**Official message CERNwide concerning Swine influenza**_

The WHO declared on the 29/4/2009 a level 5 pandemic alert for the Swine influenza, this means that larger cluster(s) of virus spread have taken place but they remain localised.  The virus is therefore increasingly better adapted to humans, but may not yet be fully transmissible (high risk of pandemic).

As a precaution:

\-      Official travel is forbidden to Mexico

\-      For those coming from Mexico in the last 7 days:

  

o    As soon as you have the first symptoms of flu (fever ≥38°, chills, muscular pain and dry cough, fatigue), it is advised that you stay at home and contact your doctor or contact the Medical Emergency Services by calling 15 (France) or 144 (SWITZERLAND) telling them that you have come from Mexico.

  

  

o    On the CERN site as soon as you have the first symptoms of flu : respect basic hygiene rules: avoid contact with colleagues (meetings), cover your mouth and nose when you cough, wash your hands frequently,  go to the infirmary (building 57 ground floor) as soon as possible during the opening hours and outside these hours call 74444 (the fire brigade) who will take care of you.

This guidance may change as new official information becomes available from WHO.

This is a recommendation. Please do not panic. Any measure, if necessary for CERN, will be organised through the Medical Service.

Congressional Climate Change Update. The House Energy and Commerce Committe  
e held four days of hearings ( energycommerce.house.gov/index.php?option3D  
com\_content&view3Darticle&id3D1593&catid3D130&Itemid3D71 ) on the Ameri  
can Clean Energy and Security Act, with much debate on the merits of moving  
 ahead on the climate and energy package. Subcommittee markup of the bill h  
as been pushed back to next week, with details such as how to allocate perm  
its to emit greenhouse gases and how the revenues will be used yet to be de  
termined. Meanwhile Senate Environment and Public Works Chairwoman Barbara  
Boxer (D-CA) announced the formation of five working groups ( epw.senate.go  
v/public/index.cfm?FuseAction3DMajority.PressReleases&ContentRecord\_id3Dd

mises in several areas of concern:  regional issues, cost containment, targ  
ets and timetables, market oversight and coal research and technology.  The  
 Senate Foreign Relations Committee ( foreign.senate.gov/hearings/2009/hrg0  
90422a.html ) heard from Todd Stern, special envoy for climate change at th  
e State Department, who testified on the diplomatic cost of inaction on cli  
mate change and emphasized the need for all countriesE28093developed and  
 developingE28093to engage in negotiations with "common but differentiat  
ed responsibilities." Stern is leading the first session of the Major Econo  
mies Forum on Energy and Climate ( www.state.gov/g/oes/climate/mem/ ) on Ap  
ril 27-28, a White House initiative to develop a dialogue among major devel  
oped and developing economies on climate change.  
  
New Bill Promotes Science Envoys.  Last week, Senator Richard Lugar (R-IN)  
introduced legislation (S. 838) ( thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:S.838  
: ) that recognizes the importance of international scientific cooperation  
and the work of organizations such as AAAS and the National Academies in th  
is area.  The legislation tasks the State Department to appoint Science Env  
oys to represent our nation and promote international collaboration.   
  
  
  
  
Executive Branch  
  
Presidential Memo on Scientific Integrity.  OSTP issued a Presidential Memo  
 on scientific integrity in the April 23 Federal Register ( edocket.access.  
gpo.gov/2009/E9-9307.htm) and requests public comments on six principles fo  
r maintaining and protecting the responsible use of science in decision-mak  
ing.  The memo builds upon a March 9, 2009 memorandum from the President th  
at called on OSTP to issue a set of recommendations within 120 days.  OSTP  
has launched a blog ( blog.ostp.gov/category/scientific-integrity/ ) on the  
 subject and is seeking comments on the selection of scientists to serve in  
 the executive branch, peer-review of science used in policy-making, access  
 to scientific data used in policy-making, and whistleblower protection.  C  
omments are due May 13, 2009. 
  
NIH Stem Cell Guidelines Now Open for Comment. The NIH Guidelines for Human  
 Stem Cell Research are now open ( edocket.access.gpo.gov/2009/E9-9313.htm  
) for public comment until May 26. 
  
NCI Director Speaks on Cancer Plan. National Cancer Institute Director John  
 Niederhuber recently spoke of his institute's plans ( www.nih.gov/news/hea  
lth/apr2009/nci-20.htm ) in the wake of President Obama's cited goal of dou  
bling funds for cancer research. Included would be a boost in the NCI payli  
ne to fund more meritorious research grants, as well as more grants to firs  
t-time investigators and new faculty researchers. There will also be a focu  
s on personalized cancer care.  
  
EPA Examines Ocean Acidification. On April 14, EPA issued a Federal Registe  
r notice ( www.biologicaldiversity.org/campaigns/ocean\_acidification/pdfs/2  
009-08638\_PI.pdf ) requesting information on ocean acidification, the chang  
ing of ocean chemistry from increases in carbon dioxide that affects coral  
reefs and other marine organisms. In response to a lawsuit by the Center fo  
r Biological Diversity, EPA is trying to determine whether changes are need  
ed to the water quality criteria under the Clean Water Act.  Comments are d  
ue June 15, 2009. 
  
Toxics Reporting Tightened. As mandated in the 2009 omnibus appropriations  
bill, EPA finalized changes to reporting requirements under the Toxics Rele  
ase Inventory ( www.epa.gov/tri/ ) that will take effect July 1. The final  
rules restore more stringent reporting requirements than those from a Bush- 
era rule that raised the pollution threshold for reporting. In 2006, AAAS s  
ubmitted comments ( www.aaas.org/spp/cstc/docs/06\_01\_12\_TRI.pdf ) stating t  
hat the increased threshold would "threaten the ability of researchers to i  
dentify and understand potential threats to the environment and public heal  
th in a scientifically rigorous manner."  
  
FDA Widens Access to "Morning-After" Pill. The Food and Drug Administration  
 will now allow 17-year-olds to purchase the Plan B "morning-after" pill wi  
thout a prescription, following a recent federal court order that it do so.  
 The decision has been labeled a "triumph of science over politics" ( www.b  
altimoresun.com/news/opinion/editorial/bal-ed.pill24apr24,0,5615724.story )  
 because of widespread concern that the previous administration overruled s  
cientific advice on making the pill available over the counter, leading the  
 FDA's top women's health official, Susan Wood, to resign ( www.washingtonp  
ost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/31/AR2005083101271.html ) in protest  
 in 2005. 
  
Nation's First CTO: Clarification.  Last week's Policy Alert reported on th  
e President's selection of Aneesh Chopra to be the nation's first chief tec  
hnology officer. It has since been reported ( www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn  
/content/article/2009/04/26/AR2009042602262.html ) that the CTO will also b  
e one of the associate directors of the Office of Science and Technology Po  
licy (OSTP) concerned with overall technology policy and innovation strateg  
ies across federal departments.  Chopra's position (which is subject to Sen  
ate confirmation) should not be confused with that of Vivek Kundra, recentl  
y named Chief Information Officer, who is located in the Office of Manageme  
nt and Budget (OMB), overseeing day-to-day information technology spending  
and interagency operations.

Climate Risk Report Released. Led by the Heinz Center and CERES, a coalitio  
n of insurance, government, environmental, and investment organizations rel  
eased a report, Resilient Coasts: A Blueprint for Action ( www.heinzctr.org  
/publications/PDF/Resilient\_Coasts\_Blueprint\_Final.pdf ) that listed steps  
the nation can take to drastically reduce rising coastal hazard risks and t  
heir associated economic impacts.  
  
Texas School Board Chairman Up for Confirmation. Texas State Board of Educa  
tion Chairman Don McLeroy, a vocal opponent of teaching evolution, is up fo  
r Senate confirmation by the state Senate, and during a recent hearing ( ww  
w.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/politics/entries/2009  
/04/22/state\_board\_of\_education\_chair.html ) some members of the Senate Nom  
inations Committee expressed dissatisfaction with McLeroy's performance. On  
e state senator said McLeroy has "created a hornet's nest" and noted that 1  
5 bills filed during this legislative session would strip powers from the s  
tate school board. Even if McLeroy is not confirmed as chairman, he will st  
ill remain a member of the board. In other news, the Institute for Creation  
 Research is now suing in U.S. District Court over the Texas Higher Educati  
on Coordinating Board's decision to deny its request to offer a master's de  
gree in science education.  
  
Animal Rights Activists Charged. Two animal rights activists have been arra

AIP FYI#51: Appropriators Review Commerce Department  
  
_**FYI  
The American Institute of Physics Bulletin of Science Policy News  
Number 51: April 29, 2009  
Web version: [http://www.aip.org/fyi/2009/051.html](http://www.aip.org/fyi/2009/051.html)  
  
Appropriators Review Department of Commerce  
  
Commerce Secretary Gary Locke has been on Capitol Hill twice within  
the last week to testify before the House and Senate Appropriations  
Subcommittees on Commerce, Justice, and Science.  While the  
department's FY 2010 budget will not be submitted to Congress for  
another week or so, Senate subcommittee chairwoman Barbara Mikulski  
(D-MD) called the  April 23 hearing the beginning of the  
subcommittee's 2010 budget hearings.  
  
Appropriators had many questions for Secretary Locke about several  
programs that have experienced management problems, while praising  
the department's science and technology programs.  Mikulski's  
opening statement touched on President Obama's agenda to  
"reinvigorate our science programs," saying that the department  had  
suffered from "unrealistic funding for science programs and labs,  
almost zero funding for technology and manufacturing partnerships  
with industry."   She described Commerce as the "innovation engine  
for this nation," saying "no other Department in our government has  
all the elements in one place to keep America competitive in this  
new century.  It starts with Commerce's sciences and research  
programs, finding new ways to solve tomorrow's problems."  Mikulski  
added, "As a leader in America's competitiveness, Commerce needs  
realistic funding, proper management and oversight to keep this  
nation scientifically relevant and technologically innovative in the  
global marketplace."  Senator Richard Shelby (R-AL), the  
subcommittee's Ranking Republican, said "through the Department of  
Commerce, our country is able to maintain high technical standards,  
as well as staying on the cutting edge of scientific research - all  
of which are fundamental to our nation's leadership in the global  
market."  
  
Secretary Locke's written statement described the Obama  
Administration's plans for the department's science and technology  
programs:  
  
"This budget supports the National Institute of Standards and  
Technology's (NIST) advanced measurement and standards activities  
that are critical to the Nation's technology infrastructure. The  
President's plan for investments in science includes doubling  
research funding within NIST over 10 years. The request includes  
$125 million for the Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership  
program to enhance the competitiveness of manufacturers by  
facilitating the adoption of efficient manufacturing processes. The  
Technology Innovation Program will receive $70 million to invest in  
high-impact research that will tackle critical national needs and  
advance innovation.  These two programs had been proposed for  
termination in the FY 2009 President's Budget. In addition, the ARRA  
\[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act\] includes $220 million for  
NIST's scientific research activities and lab equipment and $180  
million for construction of NIST facilities."  Secretary Locke's  
entire written statement can be viewed at  
[http://appropriations.senate.gov/hearings.cfm?s=com](http://appropriations.senate.gov/hearings.cfm?s=com)  
  
When compared to other troubled programs - the upcoming census,  
NOAA's satellite program, and the US Patent Office -  there was  
little discussion during the question-and-answer part of this  
hearing on Commerce's S&T programs.  Senator Lamar Alexander (R-TN)  
spoke of the America COMPETES legislation's provision on NIST  
funding, and how there was strong bipartisan congressional support,  
and support throughout the nation, for "moving at a good rate" the  
agency's funding.  Mikulski described her pride in having NIST,  
NOAA, and the Census Bureau headquartered in her State of Maryland,  
and in a NIST civil servant being a Nobel Prize winner.  She spoke  
favorably about NIST as a place where management procedures are  
working.  
  
The House Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, and  
Science met yesterday.  Again, most of the discussion at this  
hearing focused on the department's more troubled programs, with  
subcommittee chairman Alan Mollohan (D-WV) telling Locke that  
"sometimes  . . . the squeaky wheel gets the grease" in the  
subcommittee's hearings.   Mollohan expressed much concern about  
global climate change and its many manifestations, saying that only  
the Commerce Department was capable of providing a leadership role.  
He agrees with the Administration's proposal to establish a National  
Climate Service, Locke later saying that he felt that NOAA would be  
the appropriate  agency to take the lead role in climate change.  
  
Other questions during the House hearing dealt with the Commerce  
Department's role in education and encouraging students to go into  
the sciences.  Rep. John Culberson (R-TX) spoke of NIST having a  
"terrific track record of investing in peer-reviewed scientific  
research" that resulted in great benefits, later saying that the  
agency does "wonderful work."  
  
Both Mikulski and Mollohan indicated that they would have written  
questions for Secretary Locke after the Administration sends its  
FY2010 budget request to Congress.

$1 billion a day for stimulus  
  
_**    The Obama administration has committed $75 billion in stimulus money  
    in 10 weeks. So far $14.5 billion has been spent, mostly for Medicaid.  
  
By Tami Luhby  
<[http://money.cnn.com/2009/04/27/news/economy/stimulus/mailto:tami.luhby@turner.com](http://money.cnn.com/2009/04/27/news/economy/stimulus/mailto:tami.luhby@turner.com)\>,  
CNNMoney.com senior writer  
Last Updated: April 27, 2009: 2:04 PM ET  
  
NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- The federal government has made available  
more than $75 billion for stimulus projects in the 10 weeks since  
President Obama signed the $787 billion recovery package into law.  
  
Not all of that money has hit the streets, however. So far, $14.5  
billion has been spent, nearly all of it to help states cope with rising  
Medicaid costs.  
  
A CNNMoney.com analysis of the program's financial reports shows how  
difficult it is to quickly inject billions of dollars into the economy.  
Experts interviewed said they are not surprised by the pace of spending,  
though they had mixed views on whether the effort would boost the economy.  
  
"There's a natural tension between using taxpayers' money in a prudent  
way and getting the money out the door quickly," said Isabel Sawhill, a  
Brookings Institution senior fellow.  
  
The massive recovery package was designed to stimulate the economy and  
create jobs, as well as assist states and people suffering from the  
recession by providing funding for education, Medicaid and other public  
services.  
  
The federal government is now tasked with putting $499 billion to work  
in coming years. The remaining $288 billion consists of tax relief, the  
signature program of which, the Making Work Pay credit, began earlier  
this month.  
  
The Obama administration says it is satisfied with the pace of spending  
and should meet its goal of making 70% of the funds available by  
September 2010. So far, about 15% has been committed.  
  
"We're ahead of schedule and making steady progress," said Liz Oxhorn, a  
press secretary for Vice President Joe Biden, who is heading the  
recovery effort. "We're pleased."  
  
Still, the funding must pass over several hurdles before the federal  
government considers it "spent."  
  
Some dollars can flow relatively quickly through existing channels to  
the intended recipient, be it state and local governments, nonprofit  
agencies or private contractors. It's also easier to get funds for  
projects that were already in the works and just needed funding.  
  
Other money, however, remains in federal agencies' hands waiting to be  
distributed. Many would-be recipients are still wading through all the  
recovery program's requirements or waiting for guidance from federal  
agencies before they put in requests.  
  
Lastly, a significant amount of funding won't be made available until  
recipients either sign contracts or file grant applications. And in some  
cases, new programs must be created before the money can flow.  
  
How one agency is spending the money  
  
Take the Department of Health and Human Services, which is distributing  
$137 billion. It has made available nearly $29 billion to the states,  
who've claimed $13.3 billion as of April 17, according to an agency report.  
  
Just under $13.2 billion has gone to states to help them pay for  
Medicaid services. That funding has been able to move so quickly because  
it was the first pool of money the federal government made available and  
it's being pumped through an established program. States have also  
received some funds for foster care and adoption assistance and for new  
community health centers.  
  
But another $100 million for senior services -- such as nutrition  
programs at senior centers and Meals on Wheels -- is sitting unclaimed.  
States are in the process of requesting their share of the money as they  
figure out how to navigate the federal program and assess their needs  
back home.  
  
And the $1 billion slated for prevention and wellness programs hasn't  
even been committed because the agency is still working out details,  
said spokesman Nick Papas. Specifics should be announced in early summer.  
  
Meanwhile, the department is working to push more dollars out the door,  
Papas said.  
  
"Recovery Act dollars are keeping community health centers open and  
helping care for more Americans in need," Papas said. "We continue to  
work quickly and carefully to distribute Recovery Act dollars in an open  
and transparent manner."  
  
Does it need to be spent faster?  
  
Handing out nearly $500 billion in a responsible manner is not easy,  
experts said.  
  
"You can only spend so much money really fast," said Michael Ettlinger,  
vice president for economic policy at the left-leaning Center for  
American Progress.  
  
He's expecting a flood of money to hit the streets once the states file  
their requests and grant applications. But that doesn't mean the  
recovery bill isn't having an effect. The economy is already being  
helped by the program's tax credits, though that spending is harder to  
measure, he said.  
  
Because the weak economy is expected to linger, there's a benefit to  
doling out the recovery dollars slowly, said Sawhill, the Brookings  
economist. Though she's disappointed with the pace of spending so far,  
she understands why it takes time.  
  
"The fact that the money is not being spent all in the beginning is not  
a bad thing, though you do want to stop the downward spiral," she said.  
  
Other experts are skeptical as to whether the recovery program will help  
at all. Alan Viard, resident scholar at the conservative American  
Enterprise Institute, has questioned from the beginning whether  
constructing highways and bridges -- which the administration says will  
create lots of jobs -- will really stimulate the economy.  
  
"I don't think the infrastructure spending is likely to spend out at a  
fast enough rate," Viard said.

Number 49: April 27 2009Web version: http://www.aip.org/fyi/2009/049.htmlObama: 3% of GDP for R&DPresident Barack Obama addressed an overflow audience at the 146thAnnual Meeting of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) on April27. In his expansive speech, the President called for greaterinvestments in research and development, and science education.The following are select quotes from the President's speech:Federal funding in the physical sciences as a portion of our grossdomestic product has fallen by nearly half over the past quartercentury. Time and again we've allowed the research andexperimentation tax credit, which helps business grow and innovate,to lapse.Our schools continue to trail. Our students are outperformed inmath and science by their peers in Singapore, Japan, England, theNetherlands, Hong Kong, and Korea, among others. Another assessmentshows American fifteen year olds ranked 25th in math and 21st inscience when compared to nations around the world.â€œAnd we have watched as scientific integrity has been undermined andscientific research politicized in an effort to advancepredetermined ideological agendas.â€œA half century ago, this nation made a commitment to lead the worldin scientific and technological innovation; to invest in education,in research, in engineering. Since then our investments havesteadily declined as a share of our national income-our GDP [grossdomestic product].I am here today to set this goal: we will devote more than threepercent of our GDP to research and development. We will not justmeet, but we will exceed the level achieved at the height of theSpace Race, through policies that invest in basic and appliedresearch: promote breakthroughs in energy and medicine, and improveeducation in math and science. This represents the largestcommitment to scientific research and innovation in Americanhistory.Through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and with thesupport of Congress, my administration is already providing thelargest single boost to investment in basic research in Americanhistory.We double the budget of key agencies, including the NationalScience Foundation and the National Institute of Standards andTechnology. And my budget doubles funding for the Department ofEnergy's Office of ScienceMy budget makes the research and experimentation tax creditpermanent.The fact is, there will be no single Sputnik moment for thisgeneration's challenge to break our dependence on fossil fuels.That is why I have set a goal for our nation that we will reduceour carbon pollution by more than 80 percent by 2050.And today, I am also announcing that for the first time, we arefunding an initiative- recommended by this organization- called theAdvanced Research Projects Agency for Energy, or ARPA-E.And because of recent progress- not just in biology, genetics andmedicine, but also in physics, chemistry, computer science, andengineering- we have the potential to make enormous progress againstdiseases in the coming decades. That is why my Administration iscommitted to increasing funding for the National Institutes ofHeath, including $6 billion to support cancer research, part of asustained, multi-year plan to double cancer research in ourcountry.We also need to engage the scientific community directly in thework of public policy. That is why, today, I am announcing theappointment of the President's Council of Advisors on Science andTechnology, known as PCAST.It will be co-chaired by John Holdren, my top science advisor; EricLander, one of the principal leaders of the Human Genome Project;and Harold Varmus, former head of the National Institutes of Healthand a Nobel laureate.Today I am announcing a renewed commitment to education inmathematics and science.We know that the quality of math and science teachers is the mostinfluential single factor in determining whether or a student willsucceed or fail in these subjects. Yet, in high school, more thantwenty percent of students in math and more than sixty percent ofstudents in chemistry and physics are taught by teachers withoutexpertise in these fields. And this problem is only going to getworse; there is a projected shortfall of more than 280,000 math andscience teachers across the country by 2015.That is why I am announcing today that states making strongcommitments and progress in math and science education will beeligible to compete later this fall for additional funds under theSecretary of Educationâ€™s $5 billion Race to the Top program.I am challenging states to dramatically improve achievement in mathand science by raising standards, modernizing science labs,upgrading curriculum, and forging partnerships to improve the use ofscience and technology in our classrooms. And I am challengingstates to enhance teacher preparation and training, and to attractnew and qualified math and science teachers to better engagestudents and reinvigorate these subjects in our schools.There are, right now, chemists who could teacher chemistry;physicists who could teach physicsâ€¦ But we need to create a way tobring the expertise and the enthusiasm of folks- folks like you-into the classroom.My budget also triples the number of National Science Foundationgraduate research fellowships.So I want to persuade you to spend time in the classroom. Encourageyour university to participate in programs to allow students to geta degree in scientific fields and a teaching certificate at the sametime.I'm going to participate in a public awareness and outreachcampaign to encourage students to consider careers in science,mathematics, and engineering.And the Department of Energy and the National Science Foundationwill be launching a joint initiative to inspire tens of thousands ofAmerican students to pursue careers in science, engineering andentrepreneurship related to clean energy.It will create research opportunities for undergraduates andeducational opportunities for women and minorities who too oftenhave been underrepresented in scientific and technological fields.The President's speech may be listened to at,http://www.nationalacademies.org/ .

**Budget News**

The House and Senate return this week to resume legislative work after a two-week spring recess. The first order of business will be to iron out in conference the differences between the two chambers' budget resolutions for fiscal year (FY) 2010. Another priority will be to address the Administration's $83.4 billion [supplemental funding request](http://www.info-aaas.org/util/link.jsp?e=1G-ss0UhsXlo-1AQMl4hlCDH-zQs0Gar5FcdjR1RpbRXrEWFu&s=8xRo1EmCpdfNNECFo6Hc2sA..A&v=9NyiitCLY2cPuAd1AOrPwOQ..A) for the DOD FY 2009 budget for military operations, intelligence gathering and diplomatic activities in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan.

NIH Releases Stem Cell Guidelines. On April 17 the National Institutes of Health released its draft [guidelines](http://www.info-aaas.org/util/link.jsp?e=8b-GV3JGbMHd3PssHSnp4aZo4GzsD05f12UOoAy09oJn8S8tO7qAPI4H2cjfLA2s_&s=8xRo1EmCpdfNNECFo6Hc2sA..A&v=9NyiitCLY2cPuAd1AOrPwOQ..A) on federal funding for human embryonic stem cell research. NIH announced that it would fund work on stem cells derived from embryos left over at fertility clinics, provided that certain conditions are met - for example, informed consent is obtained from donors. It will not at this time fund techniques involving the creation of human embryos for research. The regulations will be finalized this summer following an initial 30-day public comment period. Meanwhile, British scientists are collaborating with Pfizer to test a procedure using embryonic stem cells to reverse age-related macular degeneration, the most common cause of blindness.  
  
Government Holds Meetings on Stimulus-Funded Biomedical Research. Last week the new 15-member Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research held the [first](http://www.info-aaas.org/util/link.jsp?e=7m05EBfGhHdS0bmlwPqDN7EAcV9O4Mm7C34UjSLWjWBcP-MJG7skxil6z6Uj41KcQ&s=8xRo1EmCpdfNNECFo6Hc2sA..A&v=9NyiitCLY2cPuAd1AOrPwOQ..A) of at least three public comment sessions on how the $1.1 billion allocated in the stimulus package for research comparing medical interventions should be spent. Subsequent meetings are tentatively scheduled for May 6 and May 13. Also last week, the National Institutes of Health convened its Advisory Committee to the Director by telephone to [discuss](http://www.info-aaas.org/util/link.jsp?e=6isk9LxiL1JpBWJFMOUpopPIPXcqzKaKThaNR_HpXQBvvHzuwIy6ocw0gt-3duHjU&s=8xRo1EmCpdfNNECFo6Hc2sA..A&v=9NyiitCLY2cPuAd1AOrPwOQ..A) stimulus funds. Committee members expressed enthusiasm for the funding and NIH's approach to it, but some were concerned about how the agency will handle the influx of grant applications and how it will adjust in 2011 when the stimulus funds will be gone.  
  
EPA Issues Endangerment Finding. On April 17, two years after the Supreme Court ordered the EPA to issue a decision on whether automobile emissions endanger human health and welfare and therefore would be regulated under the Clean Air Act, EPA issued a [proposed endangerment finding](http://www.info-aaas.org/util/link.jsp?e=59NjMrf6iykdcnOKJtJ8yVyFHfM9i6xVgRxoq4rtBJuUfpX81nxBjASY0L9IUp_fM&s=8xRo1EmCpdfNNECFo6Hc2sA..A&v=9NyiitCLY2cPuAd1AOrPwOQ..A). The finding states, "In both magnitude and probability, climate change is an enormous problem. The greenhouse gases that are responsible for it endanger public health and welfare within the meaning of the Clean Air Act." The proposed finding, which now enters a 60-day public comment period, does not include any regulations. A final endangerment finding would trigger regulation, which would be conducted through the rulemaking process. The press release accompanying the endangerment finding noted the preference of President Obama and EPA Administrator Jackson "for comprehensive legislation to address this issue and create the framework for a clean energy economy," rather than regulation under the Clean Air Act. The House Energy and Commerce Committee begins hearings this week on the draft American Clean Energy and Security Act, which contains a cap-and-trade program to limit greenhouse gas emissions (Policy Alert, 4/8/09).  
  
EPA To Test Pesticides for Endocrine Disruption. EPA has issued the [first list of pesticides](http://www.info-aaas.org/util/link.jsp?e=47YNycyl_p6XJlMxZ4G3rDzMe18M-Yi1gTvSMG7hIJAXMe8Lu&s=8xRo1EmCpdfNNECFo6Hc2sA..A&v=9NyiitCLY2cPuAd1AOrPwOQ..A) to be screened for potentially disrupting the endocrine system, which regulates growth, metabolism, and reproduction. The 67 pesticides on the list were selected for having a high potential for human exposure through food and water, presence in the home, or agricultural pesticide application.  
  
U.S. and Mexico Announce New Energy and Climate Partnership. The [US-Mexico Bilateral Framework on Clean Energy and Climate Change](http://www.info-aaas.org/util/link.jsp?e=3HAdVkrSLcAEJ1VfAFh0qQB5OmHtzyio-jcu7FGKoncBWE0MJ&s=8xRo1EmCpdfNNECFo6Hc2sA..A&v=9NyiitCLY2cPuAd1AOrPwOQ..A) will focus on renewable energy, energy efficiency, adaptation, market mechanisms, forestry and land use, green jobs, low carbon energy technology development, and capacity building. The framework will also build upon existing partnerships to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, to adapt to the local impacts of climate change in the region, and to strengthen the reliability and flow of cross-border electricity.  
  
More Presidential Nominations. Last week President Obama announced the following nominations for key Administration positions:  
\- [Daniel Poneman](http://www.info-aaas.org/util/link.jsp?e=9hkWtoeqjSJbw-2wNomQH2S6X3e08qrtOYoLnANQGsWbDP5khW8kvtdQWYCzRgLKQ&s=8xRo1EmCpdfNNECFo6Hc2sA..A&v=9NyiitCLY2cPuAd1AOrPwOQ..A), a Principal with The Scowcroft Group, to be Deputy Secretary for DOE;

Applications for H1-B Visas Decline. Federal immigration officials are reporting that the quota for H1-B visas, under which skilled foreign workers are admitted to work in the U.S. for three years (renewable for another three), mainly in the technology industry, have not been filled more than a week after they were made available. A total of 85,000 visas may be issued, including 20,000 for professionals with advanced degrees from U.S. institutions and 65,000 for those with a bachelor's degree. Persons working at universities and non-profit research institutions are exempt. During the past two years, officials at Immigration and Citizenship Services, which handles the applications, reported that their quota was exceeded within the first few days.

_AAUP Newsletter - Furloughs: NOT the Simple Solution  
  
**

It is still early days for fully evaluating higher education’s response to the worldwide recession, but a number of institutions are exploring unpaid furloughs as a short-term solution. In some cases, administrations seem to be using the external economic crisis to justify extraordinary internal measures without sufficiently consulting with faculty, providing them with adequate information about the financial condition of the institution, or taking into account alternative measures for addressing whatever financial challenges the institution faces.

Of course, when faculty or staff have collective bargaining contracts, such drastic measures are subject to negotiation. At other institutions, faculty and staff need to organize to insist that furloughs, layoffs, or salary reductions not be unilaterally imposed. All campus constituencies should be consulted and given an opportunity to propose alternatives.

The AAUP chapter at Louisiana State University responded efficiently to the challenge, issuing [a principled letter](http://www.aaup.org/AAUP/newsroom/Highlights/lsu.htm) establishing how the campus should proceed. The success that individual chapters will have in enforcing such principles will depend both on the size of their membership and the level of their resolve. It is urgent that chapters work to increase both. The strength of our Association rests in considerable part on the strength and commitment of our members, chapters, and conferences, as well as on the strength and ability of national leaders and staff to respond to emerging challenges and to support the good work of our members at the local level.

Not every faculty will want to insist that financial exigency be declared before budget adjustments can be made, but some of the principles articulated in the Louisiana letter deserve widespread consideration. The most obvious point to make is that not only faculty members but also some staff cannot simply stop working for a given period of time. Thus a furlough really means working without pay. Since that is fundamentally unacceptable, delayed compensation is the only tolerable alternative.

It is also more than misleading to suggest that a 10 percent pay cut means the same thing to an administrator earning hundreds of thousands of dollars as it does to a contingent teacher or an assistant professor. Lower-paid employees should be exempted from any form of salary reduction. Many campuses should also take this opportunity to consider reductions in the number of administrators, as well as considering disproportionate reductions in administrative compensation, which has disproportionately increased in recent decades. They should also take a look at reining in the salaries of administrators at the upper end of the salary scale.

Above all it is critical that decisions about furloughs and other salary measures be collaborative, not imposed by fiat.

Gary Rhoades, General Secretary

Excerpts from the AAAS Policy Alert  
  
****BUDGET NEWS  
Before leaving for a two-week spring recess, the House and Senate passed their respective FY 2010 budget resolutions. Following the recess, they will begin ironing out the differences between the two plans. In broad terms, the plans are similar. The House passed (by 233-196) a $3.6 trillion resolution, and the Senate voted 55-43 for a $3.53 trillion plan. The two chambers will not only have to come to agreement over the total budgetary levels, but will also have to agree on discretionary spending levels (Policy Alert, March 30, 2009). In addition, the House resolution retains language that would allow Congress to use the reconciliation process to pass health care reform and climate change legislation. The reconciliation process (which cannot be filibustered) is historically only used for passage of certain must-pass bills.

Bills on Coordinating International S&T and STEM Education Clear House Subcommittee. The Research and Education Subcommittee of the House S&T Committee [approved two bills](http://science.house.gov/press/PRArticle.aspx?NewsID=2413) that would establish two coordinating committees as part of the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) within the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). The International Science and Technology Cooperation Act of 2009 (H.R. 1736) would coordinate international science and technology activities among federal research agencies including the Department of State. The STEM Education Coordination Act of 2009 (H.R. 1709) would coordinate science education efforts across federal agencies including the Department of Education. The STEM bill is based on recommendations from a 2007 National Science Board report. Executive Branch Clinton Appoints Adviser for Innovation. Seeking to bring more technology to the nation's diplomatic efforts – including promotion of human rights as well as economic development – Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has appointed Alec Ross as senior adviser on innovation, effective April 6. Ross, who coordinated technology and innovation plans in the Obama presidential campaign (and represented then-candidate Obama at the AAAS Candidates' Forum on S&T Policy in Boston in February 2008), founded One Economy, a non-profit organization that employs technology to help low-income communities.

**Budget News**

The [House](http://www.info-aaas.org/util/link.jsp?e=0-jkh8dWkT3n-qkJdT6KB-x1pZzK62-eOhP3bpM0OixwadBG6&s=5rgrYuYbSSNEzqfcE6ucjlA..A&v=6gjIWoS02MHpntxRMPW7ySA..A) [http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111\_cong\_reports&docid=f:hr060.pdf](http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_reports&docid=f:hr060.pdf)  
 and [Senate](http://www.info-aaas.org/util/link.jsp?e=9hkWtoeqjSJbw-2wNomQH2Q80ne9ZZDBx-IY0oUv9Tb1nA4xJUgeOEn0roJBXCt39&s=5rgrYuYbSSNEzqfcE6ucjlA..A&v=6gjIWoS02MHpntxRMPW7ySA..A)  [http://budget.senate.gov/democratic/](http://budget.senate.gov/democratic/)   
Budget Committees have each passed their respective budget resolutions for FY 2010, and those will now move to the floor for votes before Congress departs for its spring recess on April 3. The budget resolution is a blueprint that sets broad guidelines for spending levels. Both chambers' resolutions have established a total budget of $3.6 trillion for the federal government. However, both plans include less discretionary spending ($1.09 trillion in the House plan, $1.079 in the Senate's) than does the Obama Administration's FY 2010 budget outline that was released last month ($1.13 trillion). Thus, there already are discrepancies between the President's and the Congress's budget starting points.

****Other Congressional News****

NIH Open Access Policy Made Permanent. A section of the FY 2009 omnibus appropriations bill, P.L. 111-8, signed into law March 11, made NIH's open access policy permanent. The provision reads in full: "Sec. 217. The Director of the National Institutes of Health ('NIH') shall require in the current fiscal year and thereafter that all investigators funded by the NIH submit or have submitted for them to the National Library of Medicine's PubMed Central an electronic version of their final, peer-reviewed manuscripts upon acceptance for publication, to be made publicly available no later than 12 months after the official date of publication: Provided, That the NIH shall implement the public access policy in a manner consistent with copyright law." This is a change from the existing policy that went into effect last year, whereby the open access requirement was subject to annual renewal by Congress. Rep. John Conyers (D-MI) is planning legislation that would overturn the newly adopted policy.

Report on Key National Challenges. The Center for the Study of the Presidency and Congress on March 27 released a wide-ranging report, [Saving America's Future: A Challenge to the American People,](http://www.info-aaas.org/util/link.jsp?e=9hkWtoeqjSJbw-2wNomQH2Q80ne9ZZDBx-IY0oUv9Tb2Q6dzoSCvlNVVT9wUv4x7T&s=5rgrYuYbSSNEzqfcE6ucjlA..A&v=6gjIWoS02MHpntxRMPW7ySA..A) [http://www.thepresidency.org/pubs/press\_SAFI\_rollout\_release\_2009.pdf](http://www.thepresidency.org/pubs/press_SAFI_rollout_release_2009.pdf)  
which included, among a number of broad national challenges, the need to invest more in science and innovation, to address energy dependence and the environment, and to strengthen the U.S. educational system to support the 21st century economy.
