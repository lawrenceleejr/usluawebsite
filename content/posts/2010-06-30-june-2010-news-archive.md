AAAS Policy Alert Excerpts  
FY11 Budget, NSF new website, NAS study of the future of research universities**

**Budget News**

After a slow start for Congressional action on appropriation bills this year, the process has begun to accelerate.  The House Homeland Security Appropriations subcommittee marked up its $44 billion bill last week, and five more House appropriations subcommittee markups are scheduled this week, before the July 4 recess.

House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) announced late last week that House leaders plan to bring what amounts to their FY 2011 budget resolution to the floor this week (although they seem to be at pains not to use that term).  The "spending plan" would set FY 2011 discretionary spending at $1.12 trillion, $7 billion less than the President's request; reaffirm commitment to a [revenue-neutral pay-as-you-go principle](http://www.members-aaas.org/l.jsp?d=5208.578260.654.0qmF2-9Ki); and announce the House's intention to vote on Senate-passed recommendations from the bipartisan [National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform](http://www.members-aaas.org/l.jsp?d=5208.578259.654.0qmF2-9Ki).  The measure may be attached to the FY 2010 supplemental defense appropriations bill, [H.R. 4899](http://www.members-aaas.org/l.jsp?d=5208.578258.654.0qmF2-9Ki), although the latter bill has stalled amid concerns that the spending is not completely offset. One strategy under consideration for passage of the supplemental appropriations bill would be to hold separate votes on the war funding and other spending in the bill.

FY11 Budget progress and outlook; New NSF Director**

FY11 Budget progress and outlook; New NSF Director  
  
From AIP FYI #67:

**Recent Developments: Appropriations, NSF Nomination, Senate COMPETES, Space Policy FY 2011 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Bill:**

The first funding bill to move will be the FY 2011 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Bill. Chairman Peter Visclosky (D-IN) and his colleagues on the House Energy and Water Development Appropriations Subcommittee will mark up its version of this bill tomorrow afternoon. The Administration requested a 6.8 percent budget increase for the Department of Energy. The [budget](http://www.aip.org/fyi/2010/015.html) for the Office of Science would increase by a requested 4.4 percent and the [National Nuclear Security Administration](http://www.aip.org/fyi/2010/023.html) by 13.4 percent. These increases are set against a backdrop of an FY 2011 Administration request for overall flat funding for almost all categories of discretionary spending, and a significant requested cut in Army Corps of Engineers funding. Typically the full Appropriations Committee meets to consider a bill one week after a subcommittee acts, at which time a report is i! ssued with specific program funding recommendations.

**FY 2011 Appropriations Outlook:**

Congressional action on the Administration’s FY 2011 budget request has slowed because of continuing disagreements over projected spending for the next five years. In April, the Senate Budget Committee approved its version of a budget planning tool - the FY2011 Senate Budget Resolution - although it was not brought before the full Senate. Yesterday House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) said the House will soon act on a one-year measure that will not be in the form of a budget resolution, drawing swift criticism from House Republicans. Having a total discretionary spending cap in place, expected to be at the same level as that in the Senate measure, will allow the appropriations bills to move. A House appropriations subcommittee will mark up the FY 2011 Homeland Security bill on Friday.

The outlook for the FY 2011 bills is very uncertain. There are deep divisions between the parties, an election this fall, and limited floor time. Hoyer said Appropriations Committee Chairman David Obey (D-WI) will likely decide the schedule for when appropriations bills come before the full House. Hoyer predicted that a continuing resolution and an omnibus funding bill will eventually be needed to complete the FY 2011 appropriations cycle, which is expected to occur well beyond the October 1 start of the new fiscal year.

**Nomination of New National Science Foundation Director:**

Earlier this month President Obama nominated [Subra Suresh](http://dmse.mit.edu/faculty/faculty/ssuresh/) to be the next director of the National Science Foundation. Suresh is the Dean of the School of Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The nomination was referred to the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions that is chaired by Tom Harkin (D-IA); Michael Enzi (R-WY) is the Ranking Member. A hearing has not been scheduled.

**COMPETES Bill:**

It now appears that the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee will mark up its version of an America COMPETES reauthorization bill in mid-July. The committee is chaired by Jay Rockefeller (D-WV); Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) is the Ranking Member. The Senate bill is expected to be much shorter than the 282-page [House-passed bill](http://www.aip.org/fyi/2010/059.html).

CERN Council opens the door to greater integration

Geneva, 18 June 2010. At its 155th session today, the CERN Council strongly congratulated the Laboratory on the excellent performance of the LHC since its start-up for physics on 30 March this year. Council also opened the door to greater integration in particle physics when it unanimously adopted the recommendations of a working group set up in 2008 to examine the role of the Organization in the light of increasing globalization in particle physics. 

The key points agreed at today’s meeting are that:

\- All states shall be eligible for Membership, irrespective of their geographical location;

\- A new Associate Membership status is to be introduced to allow non-Member States to establish or intensify their institutional links with the Organization;

\- Associate Membership shall also serve as the obligatory pre-stage to Membership;

\- The existing Observer status will be phased out for States, but retained for International Organizations;

\- International co-operation agreements and protocols will be retained.

Applications for Membership from Cyprus, Israel, Serbia, Slovenia and Turkey have already been received by the CERN Council, and are undergoing technical verification. At future meetings, Council will determine how to apply the new arrangements to these States.

_“This is a milestone in CERN’s history and a giant leap for particle physics”,_ said Michel Spiro, President of the CERN Council. _“It recognizes the increasing globalization of the field, and the important role played by CERN on the world stage.”_

_“Particle physics is becoming increasingly integrated at the global level,”_ said CERN Director General Rolf Heuer. _“Today’s decision contributes to creating the conditions that will enable CERN to play a full role in any future facility wherever in the world it might be.”_

In other business, Council recognized that further work is necessary on the Organization’s medium term plan, in order to maintain a vibrant research programme through a period of financial austerity, and endorsed CERN’s new Code of Conduct.

_“CERN’s new code of conduct enshrines the core values of this Organization,”_ said Spiro, _“__integrity, commitment, professionalism, creativity and diversity - which taken together add up to excellence.”_

CERN: Physicists and medics set out strategy on physics for health  
  
Source: CERN  
Content: Press Release  
Date Issued: 3 June 2010

Geneva 3 June 2010. Following a workshop hosted by the CERN\[1\] European particle physics laboratory in February, doctors and physicists today published a strategy for harnessing physics for health. Techniques developed for physics research have a long history of application in medicine. Today's news recognises that synergy, and sets out a programme of strengthened collaboration.

The workshop, which was the first of its kind, brought together some 400 healthcare professionals, biologists and physicists to examine the increasingly important interface between physics and health. Over recent decades, many important diagnostic and therapeutic techniques have been built on either basic physics principles, or the tools developed to conduct physics research. Notable examples are the technique of positron emission tomography (PET), which emerged in the medical community, but whose technology owes much to research in particle physics.

"Back in 1977 here at CERN we took the first PET images of a small mouse. In those early years, many physicists who were involved in developing new techniques for medical imaging had been originally trained as particle physicists," explained PET/CT pioneer David Townsend, Head of PET and SPECT Development at the Singapore Bioimaging Consortium. "Today, physicists work on various aspects of the instrumentation for medical imaging as well as in developing devices to improve surgery techniques, and assisting in the testing of new drugs."

While similar case studies abound, the workshop took a forward look, addressing the question of how the physics community can ensure that developments made in the name of physics will continue to spur further advances in medicine. Its objective was to align the needs of the medical community with innovation being made in the name of research.

"These workshops are very useful because often medical doctors and physicists may not know which aspects of their work will be relevant to one another," said Gillies McKenna of the CR-UK/MRC Gray Institute for Radiation Oncology & Biology at the University of Oxford, UK. "When they can present the questions that they are trying to ask, the technologies they have available to one another, they can certainly realise: "yes I know how to solve this problem or I know which question this technology could be used to address". And so, bringing groups together in a workshop can be very useful way of initiating the teams that you then need to put together to address new scientific questions."

Professor McKenna's view was echoed by Purificación Tejedor del Real of the EU Health Directorate, who added: "This workshop is a meeting point for physicists, doctors, biologists and researchers. It avoids everyone working in isolation. Projects carried out by physicists can be of benefit to those doctors who work on them. We must build on this collaboration between particle physics researchers and the medical community."

EVO-Skype Gateway**

Connecting to an EVO meeting from Skype is now possible. Since the new EVO-Skype gateway was  first released on May 28th on a pilot basis, reaction has been very positive. Positive feedback from several users, in diverse settings, indicates that the EVO-Skype gateway works well and is robust, with good sound quality. Requests to expand the service and move it to production have already been received and will be acted upon soon by the EVO Team. One can also connect Skype conference calls to EVO to increase the overall meeting scalability. In addition, because EVO already provides a gateway to H.323 end-points and MCUs (for example the ESnet ECS service), as well as the "plain old telephone system" (POTS) and AccessGrid/Multicast, this new EVO gateway can be used as a hub between Skype and EVO clients, as well as users of the other collaboration protocols mentioned. **[More information.](http://evo.caltech.edu/evoGate/skype.jsp)**

Geneva 3 June 2010. Following a workshop hosted by the CERN\[1\] European particle physics laboratory in February, doctors and physicists today published a strategy for harnessing physics for health. Techniques developed for physics research have a long history of application in medicine. Today's news recognises that synergy, and sets out a programme of strengthened collaboration.

The workshop, which was the first of its kind, brought together some 400 healthcare professionals, biologists and physicists to examine the increasingly important interface between physics and health. Over recent decades, many important diagnostic and therapeutic techniques have been built on either basic physics principles, or the tools developed to conduct physics research. Notable examples are the technique of positron emission tomography (PET), which emerged in the medical community, but whose technology owes much to research in particle physics.

"Back in 1977 here at CERN we took the first PET images of a small mouse. In those early years, many physicists who were involved in developing new techniques for medical imaging had been originally trained as particle physicists," explained PET/CT pioneer David Townsend, Head of PET and SPECT Development at the Singapore Bioimaging Consortium. "Today, physicists work on various aspects of the instrumentation for medical imaging as well as in developing devices to improve surgery techniques, and assisting in the testing of new drugs."

While similar case studies abound, the workshop took a forward look, addressing the question of how the physics community can ensure that developments made in the name of physics will continue to spur further advances in medicine. Its objective was to align the needs of the medical community with innovation being made in the name of research.

"These workshops are very useful because often medical doctors and physicists may not know which aspects of their work will be relevant to one another," said Gillies McKenna of the CR-UK/MRC Gray Institute for Radiation Oncology & Biology at the University of Oxford, UK. "When they can present the questions that they are trying to ask, the technologies they have available to one another, they can certainly realise: "yes I know how to solve this problem or I know which question this technology could be used to address". And so, bringing groups together in a workshop can be very useful way of initiating the teams that you then need to put together to address new scientific questions."

Professor McKenna's view was echoed by Purificación Tejedor del Real of the EU Health Directorate, who added: "This workshop is a meeting point for physicists, doctors, biologists and researchers. It avoids everyone working in isolation. Projects carried out by physicists can be of benefit to those doctors who work on them. We must build on this collaboration between particle physics researchers and the medical community."

Hadron Collider Physics 2010 in Toronto**

The University of Toronto in Canada is hosting HCP2010 at the end of the summer (August 23-27, 2010). This will be an outstanding opportunity to hear from world-leading experts on all aspects of hadron collider physics 'at home' (ie. in North America) at this exciting time in our field. The agenda for the meeting is available at: [http://hcp2010.physics.utoronto.ca/HCP2010\_Schedule.pdf](http://hcp2010.physics.utoronto.ca/HCP2010_Schedule.pdf)

I invite all of you to join us for this meeting to hear the latest news from the LHC machine, ATLAS/CMS and the other experiments as well as the most recent results from the Tevatron. While it may be a challenge to get one of the ATLAS or CMS talks we've requested, we are planning two poster sessions. We hope to be able to accommodate anyone who is interested in presenting their work in that form.

EVO-Skype Gateway**

Connecting to an EVO meeting from Skype is now possible. Since the new EVO-Skype gateway was  first released on May 28th on a pilot basis, reaction has been very positive. Positive feedback from several users, in diverse settings, indicates that the EVO-Skype gateway works well and is robust, with good sound quality. Requests to expand the service and move it to production have already been received and will be acted upon soon by the EVO Team. One can also connect Skype conference calls to EVO to increase the overall meeting scalability. In addition, because EVO already provides a gateway to H.323 end-points and MCUs (for example the ESnet ECS service), as well as the "plain old telephone system" (POTS) and AccessGrid/Multicast, this new EVO gateway can be used as a hub between Skype and EVO clients, as well as users of the other collaboration protocols mentioned.

Requests to expand the service and move it to production have already been received and will be acted upon soon by the EVO Team. One can also connect Skype conference calls to EVO to increase the overall meeting scalability. In addition, because EVO already provides a gateway to H.323 end-points and MCUs (for example the ESnet ECS service), as well as the "plain old telephone system" (POTS) and AccessGrid/Multicast, this new EVO gateway can be used as a hub between Skype and EVO clients, as well as users of the other collaboration protocols mentioned.

CERN: Physicists and medics set out strategy on physics for health**

Source: CERN Content: Press Release Date Issued: 3 June 2010

Geneva 3 June 2010. Following a workshop hosted by the CERN\[1\] European particle physics laboratory in February, doctors and physicists today published a strategy for harnessing physics for health. Techniques developed for physics research have a long history of application in medicine. Today's news recognises that synergy, and sets out a programme of strengthened collaboration.

The workshop, which was the first of its kind, brought together some 400 healthcare professionals, biologists and physicists to examine the increasingly important interface between physics and health. Over recent decades, many important diagnostic and therapeutic techniques have been built on either basic physics principles, or the tools developed to conduct physics research. Notable examples are the technique of positron emission tomography (PET), which emerged in the medical community, but whose technology owes much to research in particle physics.

"Back in 1977 here at CERN we took the first PET images of a small mouse. In those early years, many physicists who were involved in developing new techniques for medical imaging had been originally trained as particle physicists," explained PET/CT pioneer David Townsend, Head of PET and SPECT Development at the Singapore Bioimaging Consortium. "Today, physicists work on various aspects of the instrumentation for medical imaging as well as in developing devices to improve surgery techniques, and assisting in the testing of new drugs."

While similar case studies abound, the workshop took a forward look, addressing the question of how the physics community can ensure that developments made in the name of physics will continue to spur further advances in medicine. Its objective was to align the needs of the medical community with innovation being made in the name of research.

"These workshops are very useful because often medical doctors and physicists may not know which aspects of their work will be relevant to one another," said Gillies McKenna of the CR-UK/MRC Gray Institute for Radiation Oncology & Biology at the University of Oxford, UK. "When they can present the questions that they are trying to ask, the technologies they have available to one another, they can certainly realise: "yes I know how to solve this problem or I know which question this technology could be used to address". And so, bringing groups together in a workshop can be very useful way of initiating the teams that you then need to put together to address new scientific questions."

Professor McKenna's view was echoed by Purificación Tejedor del Real of the EU Health Directorate, who added: "This workshop is a meeting point for physicists, doctors, biologists and researchers. It avoids everyone working in isolation. Projects carried out by physicists can be of benefit to those doctors who work on them. We must build on this collaboration between particle physics researchers and the medical community."

Hadron Collider Physics 2010 in Toronto**

The University of Toronto in Canada is hosting HCP2010 at the end of the summer (August 23-27, 2010). This will be an outstanding opportunity to hear from world-leading experts on all aspects of hadron collider physics 'at home' (ie. in North America) at this exciting time in our field. The agenda for the meeting is available at: [http://hcp2010.physics.utoronto.ca/HCP2010\_Schedule.pdf](http://hcp2010.physics.utoronto.ca/HCP2010_Schedule.pdf)

I invite all of you to join us for this meeting to hear the latest news from the LHC machine, ATLAS/CMS and the other experiments as well as the most recent results from the Tevatron. While it may be a challenge to get one of the ATLAS or CMS talks we've requested, we are planning two poster sessions. We hope to be able to accommodate anyone who is interested in presenting their work in that form.
