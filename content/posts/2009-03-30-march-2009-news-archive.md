House Letter in support of 8% increase for Office of Science  

Dear Colleagues,  
  
Please write to your Congressional Representatives within the  
next couple of days, asking them to sign the House Letter in support  
of an 8% Increase in Office of Science funding in 2010. See the link to instructions  
below.  
You may also consider including a sentence emphasizing the  
_strong partnership between the DOE laboratories and universities,  
in the LHC program for example, that is at the root of our success  
in fundamental research in the physical sciences_. As I have mentioned  
emphasizing this partnership will help Congress to appreciate the  
fact that the DOE Office of Science is a prime supporter of broad based  
basic research in the physical sciences, along with the National Science  
Foundation.  
  
Best regards  
Â Harvey

FYIThe American Institute of Physics Bulletin of Science Policy NewsNumber 37: March 30, 2009Web version: http://www.aip.org/fyi/2009/037.htmlShort Deadline: House Letter in Support of 8% Increase for Officeof ScienceMarch 30, 2009, No. 37There is not much time for representatives to sign a letter tothe senior leadership of the House Energy and Water DevelopmentAppropriations Subcommittee in support of an 8 percent FR 2010funding increase for the Department of Energy's Office ofScience. A letter will be sent this Friday, April 3, toSubcommittee Chairman Peter Visclosky (D-IN) and Ranking MemberRodney Frelinghuysen (R-NJ). This effort is being lead by Rep.Judy Biggert (R-IL), Rep. Ellen Tauscher (D-CA), and Rep. RushHolt (D-NJ). In reaching its conclusion, the letter states:"we urge you to increase funding for the DOE Office of Science inFiscal Year 2010 by 8 percent over Fiscal Year 2009, consistentwith President Obama's plan to double the Federal investment inthe basic sciences within the next decade. Furthermore, we urgeyou to focus this funding on mission-related activities andfacilities, and to avoid using core DOE research program budgetsto fund extraneous projects. With this funding, the DOE Office ofScience will attract the best minds, educate the next generationof scientists and engineers, support the construction andoperation of modern facilities, and conduct even more of thequality scientific research that will create jobs and ensure theU.S. retains its competitive edge for many years to come."Members of Congress are far more likely to sign such a letter ifthey are requested to do so by a constituent. Seehttp://www.aip.org/gov/nb1.html for guidance on how to do so.Contact information can be accessed at http://www.house.gov/  Thefull text of the Biggert-Holt-Tauscher letter follows below:Dear Chairman Visclosky and Ranking Member Frelinghuysen:As you begin your work on the Fiscal Year 2010 Energy and WaterAppropriations bill, we write to express our strong support forthe Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Science Inparticular, we urge you to increase Fiscal Year 2010 funding forits research and facilities by 8 percent over Fiscal Year 2009 to$5.2 billion, which is consistent with President Obama's plan todouble the Federal investment in the basic sciences within thenext decade.In recent years, Congress has come to recognize that science willbe the foundation for the innovation and solutions that willenable us to overcome many of our greatest challenges -from oureconomic crises and environmental concerns to our dependence onforeign energy and escalating health care costs - and to remainglobally competitive as a nation. As evidenced by theoverwhelming bipartisan vote for enactment of the AmericaCOMPETES Act in 2007 (P.L. 110-69), both Democrats andRepublicans support efforts to double federal funding for basicresearch in the physical sciences within the next decade.Congress built on this commitment by funding the programs andactivities authorized by the America COMPETES Act in the AmericanRecovery and Reinvestment Act and in the Fiscal Year 2009 OmnibusAppropriations bill.Congress must build on and provide the resources to sustain thisinvestment in Fiscal Year 2010. Report after report - from theNational Academy of Sciences and the President's Council ofAdvisors on Science and Technology to the Task Force on theFuture of American Innovation and the Council on Competitiveness- has called on Congress and the President to invest in U.S.research capabilities. The benefits of such an investment to theU.S. economy and U.S. competitiveness are well known. Economicexperts have concluded that science-driven technology hasaccounted for more than 50 percent of the growth of the U.S.economy during the last half-century.This kind of technology-based economic growth cannot be sustainedwithout additional investment in the kind of basic researchsupported by the DOE Office of Science. We face a world in whichour economic competitors in Asia and Europe are makingsignificant new investments in their own research capabilities.These investments are beginning to payoff, as Asian and Europeancountries challenge U.S. leadership in the sciences no matter howit is measured -- by number of patents won, articles submitted toscientific journals, degrees awarded, Nobel prizes won, or thepercentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) dedicated to researchand development.Even as we face greater international competition, these areexciting times for science in the United States. There are manygreat opportunities for scientific discovery, and with adequatefunding, the DOE Office of Science will ensure the U.S. retainsits dominance in such key scientific fields as nanotechnology,materials science, biotechnology, and supercomputing well intothe next century. Through critical new investments in biofuelsresearch and basic energy science, the DOE Office of Science willcontinue to play a vital role in developing the knowledge and thetechnologies essential to ensuring the nation's future energysecurity. Finally, increased funding for the DOE Office ofScience will give the economy a boost in the near-term bycreating good-paying, American jobs in construction,manufacturing, and research. And in the long-term, such aninvestment in the nation's scientific and research enterprise -both human and physical capital - will increase our capacity toinnovate, reduce our dependence on foreign sources of energy,enhance our competitive edge in the global economy, and thuscreate the jobs of the future.U.S. scientists are as bright as any in the world, but theytraditionally have had better tools than everyone else. The DOEOffice of Science has led the way in creating a unique system oflarge-scale, specialized user facilities for scientificdiscovery. This collection of cutting-edge - often one-of-a-kind- tools makes the DOE Office of Science an exceptional andcritical component of the federal science portfolio. Otherfederal science agencies, such as the National Institutes ofHealth (NIH) and the National Science Foundation (NSF), greatlydepend upon these DOE Office of Science facilities in carryingout their own research activities. In Fiscal Year 2009 alone,over 21,500 researchers have access to these special DOEfacilities. Nearly half of those users will be university facultyand students - many whose research is being supported by otherfederal agencies - and a significant number will be from U.S.industry.For these many reasons, we urge you to increase funding for theDOE Office of Science in Fiscal Year 2010 by 8 percent overFiscal Year 2009, consistent with President Obama's plan todouble the Federal investment in the basic sciences within thenext decade. Furthermore, we urge you to focus this funding onmission-related activities and facilities, and to avoid usingcore DOE research program budgets to fund extraneous projects.With this funding, the DOE Office of Science will attract thebest minds, educate the next generation of scientists andengineers, support the construction and operation of modernfacilities, and conduct even more of the quality scientificresearch that will create jobs and ensure the U.S. retains itscompetitive edge for many years to come.Thanks for your consideration. We are cognizant of the difficultbudget situation under which your subcommittee is working, and weurge you to contact us if we may be of assistance in any way.Sincerely,###############Richard M.

Industry News  
Â Â Â Â Â  \*Scientific publishing faces a sea change\*  
March 25, 2009  
  
Alexis Madrigal, blogging on /Wired Magazine's /science webpage,  
describes the critical mass reached recently in the open access movement  
for scientific, peer-reviewed articles. What the move by MIT's faculty  
means for scientific publishers is uncertain, however. The new model may  
well be used by an increasing number of researchers, but authors may  
also opt out of open access and obtain the review services the  
publishers offer./Madrigal writes:/  
  
Scientific publishing might have just reached a tipping point, thanks to  
a new open access policy at MIT.  
  
Following a more limited open-access mandate at Harvard  
<[http://chronicle.com/news/article/3943/harvard-faculty-adopts-open-access-requirement](http://chronicle.com/news/article/3943/harvard-faculty-adopts-open-access-requirement)\>,  
the legendary school's faculty voted last week to make all of their  
papers available for free on the web, the first university-wide policy  
of its sort.  
  
Hal Abelson, who spearheaded the effort, said that these agreements went  
beyond providing a repository for papers, they changed the power  
dynamics between scientific publishers and researchers.  
  
"What's important here is that it's giving the university a formal role  
in how publications happen," Abelson said. "Some of the faculty said,  
'You're calling this an open-access resolution but actually the way to  
think of it is as a collective bargaining agreement.'"  
  
Many scientists and researchers have pushed for open access policies,  
but publishers have been reluctant to give up control of the  
informational resources they have. Big companies like Wiley John & Sons  
<[http://www.google.com/finance?tkr=1&q=NYSE:JW.A](http://www.google.com/finance?tkr=1&q=NYSE:JW.A)\>, The Macmillan  
Publishers' Nature Publishing Group <[http://www.nature.com/](http://www.nature.com/)\>, and Reed  
Elsevier <[http://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE:ENL](http://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE:ENL)\> argue that they  
provide valuable and expensive peer-review, and that there's no way to  
ensure quality without the subscription fees that they charge libraries  
and universities.  
  
But open access advocates say the current scientific publishing paradigm  
is broken because publishers control the scientific record, not academics.  
  
"Who actually should be controlling the scholarly record?" Abelson  
asked. "Universities have a mission that has something to do with  
producing and disseminating knowledge. These publishers, whatever their  
good intentions may be, have a mission to make money for their  
stockholders. The system is a little out of whack."  
  
That's a major reason that Congress approved an open access policy for  
National Institutes of Health-funded research. Under the NIH public  
access policy <[http://publicaccess.nih.gov/](http://publicaccess.nih.gov/)\>, papers are made public  
twelve months after publication.  
  
The scientific publishing system, which developed long before the  
internet, doesn't allow for scientific information to be accessed freely  
like most web content is. This creates data silos within individual  
publisher's journals and prevents the sharing and data mining of  
scientific information, open access advocates argue.  
  
Paul Ginsparg, who created the physics pre-print server known as arXiv  
<[http://arxiv.org/](http://arxiv.org/)\>, summarized the problem back in 2000. 
  
"If we were to start from scratch today to design a quality controlled  
distribution system for research findings," he wrote  
<[http://www.biomedcentral.com/meetings/2000/foi/editorials/ginsparg](http://www.biomedcentral.com/meetings/2000/foi/editorials/ginsparg)\>,  
"it would likely take a very different form both from the current system  
and from the electronic clone it would spawn without more constructive  
input from the research community.  
  
Read the rest of Madrigal's report and see further links here  
<[http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/03/openmit.html](http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/03/openmit.html)\>.  
  
To track those developments, keep an eye on Dspace  
<[http://www.dspace.org/](http://www.dspace.org/)\>, where the MIT papers will soon be published.

_**March 21, 2009**_

From Bill Foster - Your Ideas and Concerns

Dear Friend,  
  
Thank you. I am amazed and overwhelmed at the number of thoughtful comments you sent me in response to an earlier email where I asked you to share with me what issues you wanted me to address in Congress. The response was more than I could have ever imagined.  
  
My campaign received hundreds of emails and what impressed me most was the time you took in responding to my question. Many emails included specific proposals that I can take directly to my colleagues. Because of you, we have created a virtual "think tank" and  
with your insight and expertise, I am even better prepared to take on some of the most difficult problems we face as Americans.  
  
The concerns you raised align with my own as the issues you most wanted me to address include - improving the economy, increasing science funding and reforming health care. But there were many more issues that must be taken on like reducing the threat of nuclear weapons, restoring civil liberties and the Constitution and ending the War in Iraq.  
  
Let me be clear - I intend to work on all of these issues.  
  
These are the issues we care about and that must be addressed if we are going to truly bring change to Washington and the rest of  
country.  
  
Because we feel so strongly about these and other issues, I'd like to share with you excerpts from some of the emails I received.  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
  
"We need more Congressional champions for science. But, not just in principle or in the abstract. What's missing is someone who  
understands the intricacies and importance of the academic scientific program in the U.S."  
  
"Build a honest, competent, transparent government. The government has been so corrupted and politicized that it cannot function for the people until the old way of governing and these people are cleared out."  
  
"I too am so happy that we finally have a leader who considers the needs of everyday Americans rather than enriching the top wage earners. I have a fairly long list of things I am watching but my biggest concern, particularly over the last few days, is how many roadblocks the Republicans are  
throwing up to thwart President Obama's progress in rolling back the disaster policies of the Bush Administration. I can't believe they are  
singing the song of fiscal responsibility after allowing an open checkbook without oversight during the last 8 years! The hypocrisy is  
unbelievable!"  
  
"The change that is needed is in Kendall County. There is no public transportation in this county."  
  
"Tax and manpower policies must work together to rebuild the middle class. The growing and historically extreme economic inequality that Bush policies caused must be reversed. Otherwise the social fabric of the nation is in jeopardy."  
  
"Thanks for soliciting my input. I'm a member of the Letter Carriers Union and have met you with several times. Dennis Hastert never asked what I thought, and when I told him, I would get a letter back saying that George Bush has the right plan, and we're going to implement  
it."  
  
"I would suggest serious investments in 21st Century infrastructure - physical and human. This implies e.g. transport systems (vehicles, energy  
supply, and routes) that remove our oil dependence - not just more roads - as well as major investments in education, long term scientific research, R and D credits for business."  
  
"Restore the Constitution and a reasonable balance of power between the three branches of the federal government. Civil liberties must be fully restored, sooner rather than later."  
  
"Every scientific research group on every university campus in the nation is "shovel ready." We'll hire more graduate students, hire more  
undergraduate students, hire more post docs, and seed the economy with uniquely qualified young scientists ready to help turn the nation's economy  
around."  
  
"As a parent, I want my daughters to have good public schools (and I believe public education should be good enough for anyone's children) and affordable, excellent universities. I want my daughters to take part in research, explore new boundaries, and not have to expect a lower level of learning than I had. I involve undergraduate and graduate students (and sometimes high school teachers and students) in our research at CERN and Jlab. I can witness the impact it has on their minds, at 18 or 58 years old."  
  
"George W. Bush left us with such a mess that I could write for weeks."  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
  
Like the last respondent we quoted, I too could write for weeks based on the tremendous input I received.  
  
Thank you for your suggestions, and please keep them coming.  
  
Sincerely yours,  
Bill

NSF, Other Science Agencies Describe Intentions for Stimulus Funding  
  
The National Science Foundation has released a three-page document  
providing an overview of how it will utilize the $3.0 billion it  
received in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.Â  Under this  
legislation, the funding is distributed as follows:  
  
Research and Related Activities: $2.5 billion  
Education and Human Resources: $100 million  
Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction: $400 million  
  
As previously reviewed in FYI #16 (see  
[http://www.aip.org/fyi/2009/016.html)](http://www.aip.org/fyi/2009/016.html%29) the Joint Explanatory  
Statement accompanying the bill included the following language  
specifying how this funding is to be applied within each of the  
three budget categories:  
  
"RESEARCH AND RELATED ACTIVITIES  
  
"For research and related activities, the conference agreement  
provides a total of $2,500,000,000, to remain available until  
September 30, 2010. Within this amount, $300,000,000 shall be  
available solely for the major research instrumentation program and  
$200,000,000 shall be available for activities authorized by title  
II of Public Law 100-570 for academic facilities modernization. In  
allocating the resources provided under this heading, the conferees  
direct that NSF support all research divisions and support  
advancements in supercomputing technology."  
  
"EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES  
"The conference agreement includes $100,000,000 for education and  
human resources, to remain available until September 30, 2010. These  
funds shall be allocated as follows:  
Robert Noyce Scholarship Program: $60,000,000  
Math and Science Partnerships: $25,000,000  
Professional Science Master's Programs: $15,000,000"  
  
"MAJOR RESEARCH EQUIPMENT AND FACILITIES CONSTRUCTION  
"The conference agreement includes $400,000,000 for major research  
equipment and facilities construction, to remain available until  
September 30, 2010."  
  
$2.0 million was also provided to the NSF Office of Inspector  
General.  
  
National Science Foundation Director Arden Bement has just released  
"Important Notice to Presidents of Universities and Colleges and  
Heads of Other National Science Foundation Awardee Organizations"  
providing further details about how the foundation will use this  
funding.Â  Director Bement explains:  
  
"NSF currently has many highly rated proposals that it has not been  
able to fund. For this reason,Â  NSF is planning to use the majority

Budget News  
  
Nearly six months into the fiscal year, on March 10, Congress gave final  
approval to the FY 2009 omnibus bill combining nine unfinished  
appropriations bills. President Obama signed it into law the next day.  
The Democratic Congressâs decision to delay completing 2009  
appropriations until after the election appears to have paid off,  
allowing the new 111th Congress to provide additional domestic  
discretionary funds including R&D. Included in the $410 billion omnibus  
bill is $151.1 billion in federal R&D, an increase of $6.8 billion or  
4.7 percent above the FY 2008 estimate. As a result, every major R&D  
funding agency would receive an increase greater than expected  
inflation, and in many cases the final FY 2009 numbers are larger than  
the budget request submitted by the previous administration to the 110th  
Congress. The National Science Foundation (NSF), the Department of  
Energyâs Office of Science (DOE OS), Commerceâs National Institute of  
Standards and Technology laboratories (NIST) â agencies slated for  
doubling as part of the America COMPETES Act â would receive substantial  
increases in their respective R&D portfolios. NSF R&D would increase 8.2  
percent to $4.8 billion; DOE OS, 17.3 percent to $4.3 billion; and NIST,  
7.5 percent to $561 million for R&D. The National Institutes of Health  
(NIH) would receive a 3.2 percent increase. Note that these numbers do  
not include stimulus funding.  
  
As for FY 2010, House and Senate leaders say they want to adopt their  
respective budget resolutions before the spring recess, which begins  
April 4. That means the Budget Committees will likely mark up their  
blueprints the week of March 23. This would take place before the  
Congress has received the detailed FY 2010 proposed budget from the  
Administration, scheduled for release in late April. The President  
released a general "outline" of his FY 2010 budget proposals on February 26. 
  
Other Congressional News  
  
Holdren-Lubchenco Nominations Clear Senate Committee. The nominations of  
John Holdren to be Director of the White House Office of Science and

Commerce and Administrator of NOAA, which had been on hold for nearly a  
month (Policy Alert, 3/9/09), were reported favorably out of the Senate  
Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee last week. The timing of  
Senate floor action is uncertain.

Dear Colleagues,  
  
Here is UNOFFICIAL information gathered by US CMS CB Chair Nick Hadley  
and forwarded with his and DOE's permission. Further, specific  
information will  
come from DOE soon.  
  
Thanks to Nick for this.  
Best regards  
Harvey  
  
\[From Nick\]  
  
Stimulus funding derives from the stimulus bill and  
supplemental funding comes from the regular 2009 DOE funding bill  
which was passed only last week. The stimulus funding is  
expected to have a larger than normal amount of  
oversight. No agency wants to be featured in the news as have  
wasted funding on unneeded projects (or ones that merely appear  
unneeded).  
  
Here's what I have heard from the DOE. I'm still trying  
to get information from the NSF. The bottom line is to get your  
requests ready.  
  
Â  "Our office is still formalizing the details before putting out a  
Â Â  call for both supplements and stimulus requests.Â  (We) expect the  
Â Â  university PIs will be notified within a week or so.  
  
Â Â  Due to the way stimulus money needs to be tracked, we are planning  
Â Â  to separate requests for infrastructure (equipment, computing,  
Â Â  collaborative tools) and personnel/travel.Â  The former will be  
Â Â  one-time requests with stimulus grants, and the latter will be  
Â Â  through supplements.Â  The exact language may change, but you should  
Â Â  prepare your proposals (short, but precise) based on the above  
Â Â  distribution, and be ready to submit them quickly once you receive  
Â Â  notice.Â  All stimulus requests will be peer-reviewed by a panel."  
  
  
Hope this helps. Please let me know if you have questions or more  
information.  
  
Regards,  
Nick

Fermilab experiments constrain Higgs mass  
  
CDF, DZero experiments exclude significant fraction of Higgs territory  
  
Batavia, Ill.--The territory where the Higgs boson may be found continues  
to shrink. The latest analysis of data from the CDF and DZero collider  
experiments at the U.S. Department of Energy's Fermilab now excludes a  
significant fraction of the allowed Higgs mass range established by  
earlier measurements. Those experiments predict that the Higgs particle  
should have a mass between 114 and 185 GeV/c^2. Now the CDF and DZero  
results carve out a section in the middle of this range and establish that  
it cannot have a mass in between 160 and 170 GeV/c^2. 
  
"The outstanding performance of the Tevatron and CDF and DZero together  
have produced this important result," said Dennis Kovar, Associate  
Director of the Office of Science for High Energy Physics at the U.S.  
Department of Energy.Â  "We're looking forward to further Tevatron  
constraints on the Higgs mass."  
  
The Higgs particle is a keystone in the theoretical framework known as the  
Standard Model of particles and their interactions. According to the  
Standard Model, the Higgs boson explains why some elementary particles  
have mass and others do not.  
  
So far, the Higgs particle has eluded direct detection. Searches at the  
Large Electron Positron collider at the European laboratory CERN  
established that the Higgs boson must weigh more than 114 GeV/c^2. 
Calculations of quantum effects involving the Higgs boson require its mass  
to be less than 185 GeV/c^2. 
  
"A cornerstone of NSF's support of particle physics is the search for the  
origin of mass, and this result takes us one step closer," said Physics  
Division Director Joe Dehmer, of the National Science Foundation.  
  
The observation of the Higgs particle is also one of the goals of the  
Large Hadron Collider experiments at CERN, which plans to record its first  
collision data before the end of this year.  
  
The success of probing the Higgs territory at the Tevatron has been  
possible thanks to the excellent performance of the accelerator and the  
continuing improvements that the experimenters incorporate into the  
analysis of the collider data.  
  
"Fermilab's Tevatron collider typically produces about ten million  
collisions per second," said DZero co-spokesperson Darien Wood, of  
Northeastern University. "The Standard Model predicts how many times a  
year we should expect to see the Higgs boson in our detector, and how  
often we should see particle signals that can mimic a Higgs. By refining  
our analysis techniques and by collecting more and more data, the true  
Higgs signal, if it exists, will sooner or later emerge."  
  
To increase their chances of finding the Higgs boson, the CDF and DZero  
scientists combine the results from their separate analyses, effectively  
doubling the data available.  
  
"A particle collision at the Tevatron collider can produce a Higgs boson  
in many different ways, and the Higgs particle can then decay into various  
particles," said CDF co-spokesperson Rob Roser, of Fermilab. "Each  
experiment examines more and more possibilities. Combining all of them, we  
hope to see a first hint of the Higgs particle."  
  
So far, CDF and DZero each have analyzed about three inverse femtobarns of  
collision data---the scientific unit that scientists use to count the  
number of collisions. Each experiment expects to receive a total of about  
10 inverse femtobarns by the end of 2010, thanks to the superb performance  
of the Tevatron. The collider continues to set numerous performance  
records, increasing the number of proton-antiproton collisions it  
produces.  
  
The Higgs search result is among approximately 70 results that the CDF and  
DZero collaborations presented at the annual conference on Electroweak  
Physics and Unified Theories known as the Rencontres de Moriond, held  
March 7-14. In the past year, the two experiments have produced nearly 100  
publications and about 50 Ph.D.s that have advanced particle physics at  
the energy frontier.

Obama gets omnibus and earmark fight  
By: David Rogers  
March 10, 2009 07:22 PM EST

A $409.6 billion omnibus appropriations bill cleared Congress Tuesday even as the White House pursued new steps to try to pare back the level of parochial spending projects attached to the budget each year.

President Barack Obama is poised to sign the measure into law quickly to avoid any disruption of government operations. But Democrats anticipate that he may use the occasion Wednesday to outline new earmark reforms and answer Republican critics led by his old rival Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.)

The decisive Senate vote came on a 62-35 roll call in which Democrats finally reached the 60-vote super majority threshold that had eluded them only last week. Eight Republicans joined in the motion to cut off debate, allowing Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) to succeed even with three of his own Democrats defecting.

A Treasury letter related to Cuba travel provisions in the bill proved pivotal as well in winning over needed votes. But just to get to the final cloture roll call, Reid had to first beat back a series a series of politically punishing Republican amendments, many designed to delay enactment by forcing further consideration in the House.

The most dangerous was offered by Sen. David Vitter (R-La.) requiring the House and Senate to vote on any future cost-of-living increases for lawmakers rather than allow the pay adjustment to take effect automatically. Given the collapsing economy, Democrats are already committed to canceling any pay adjustment for next year as part of the omnibus bill. And Reid offered a stand-alone bill to accomplish the same result Vitter wanted without entangling the omnibus in the fight.

The Louisianan argued that Democrats were only seeking political cover, and he forced an up-and-down vote on his proposal alone. It was narrowly tabled by a vote of 52-45, setting up the votes on cloture and passage.

Five months late already, the giant measure is really nine bills in one, covering more than 12 Cabinet-level departments and agencies that represent the heart of the domestic budget this year as well as U.S. contributions to global health and foreign aid programs overseas.

The total cost represents a nearly $20 billion increase over the former Bush administrationâs spending requests for the fiscal year that began last October. Rather than engage in veto fights last fall, Democrats opted to postpone action until Obama took power in January.

Major increases include new money for food and consumer product safety agencies as well as Wall Street regulators and tax enforcement. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is promised $550 million more for its operations, and an additional $76.5 million is provided for U.S. attorneys to forestall threatened furloughs. IRS spending for tax enforcement is increased to $5.1 billion, a $337 million increase over last yearâs level.

Significant new money is provided for education and science initiatives, including a $309 million increase for weather and climate satellites and $754 million for the Energy Departmentâs Office of Science. From clean water to transit and highway spending, the measure builds on the landmark public works investments already made in the recently enacted economic stimulus bill.

Beyond appropriations, the billâs 1,132 pages carry with them legislative provisions touching on an array of issues. State attorneys general are given new powers to pursue truth-in-lending cases. The bill terminates an 18-month pilot program to allow Mexican-licensed trucks to compete for long-haul routes in the United States. And down to the last hours, a set of Cuba travel provisions required the Treasury Department to step in to ease differences among Democrats that threatened passage.

The Mexico truck program began in September 2007 as a way for the United States to meet its commitment under NAFTA to allow freer trucking operations on both sides of the border. But it has faced persistent opposition in Congress, and a recent Transportation Department report found that only 29 of 100 projected Mexican carriers were admitted to the project, and this âlevel of participation is not adequate to yield statistically valid findings.â

The Cuba travel provisions most directly pit two former House Democratic colleagues, New York Rep. Jose Serrano and now Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey, against one another. At issue are Bush-era restrictions on Cuba-Americans visiting relatives in Cuba as well as persons traveling for the purpose of arranging commercial sales of agriculture or medical goods allowed under US sanctions.

Serrano, who oversees Treasuryâs budget on the House Appropriations Committee, favors a more liberalized approach and has predicted Obama will as well. But in a letter dated Monday to Menendez, Secy. Timothy Geithner pledged that any such business missions would be narrowly prescribed, require full reporting and be subject to a per diem expenditure cap.

That helped get the New Jersey Democratâs vote, but it could be a short-lived truce. In a press release immediately after passage, Serrano warned the bill is ânot subject to creative interpretationâ and has âthe force of law.â

Thus to describe the giant measure as routine â as some have â doesnât really do it justice. But this is scarcely the first time that Congress has resorted to such a catch-all omnibus to wrap up the budget business for an entire year.

The situation is very similar to early 2003, when Republicans and the Bush administration pushed through a nearly $400 billion package after the budget process had collapsed amid partisan fighting the prior year. Filling almost 1,160 pages, that measure was even more complex, including Medicare and farm-disaster spending as well as appropriations. But it moved through the Senate in about six days, and after a quick conference with the House it was signed by Bush.

Looking back, the 2003 debate was much more substantive and focused on major accounts within the bill, rather than on the spending earmarks. By comparison, the current measure devotes substantially less money to earmarks, but that issue has come to dominate the politics so much that it has dwarfed most other issues in the six days of debate.

Caught most in the middle are those Republicans historically allied with the Appropriations committees and with their own stake in earmarks for their home states. Sen. Arlen Specter is such a case. Yet as a senior member of the once-proud panel, he was very cautious even Tuesday about committing himself to the bill.

Back home, he faces a potential challenge from the right in next yearâs Republican primary, and supporting even his old committee can be politically dangerous. Taxpayers for Common Sense lists about $25.3 million in earmarks requested by Specter alone in the bill, but when asked Tuesday afternoon about his vote, the Pennsylvania Republican was still hesitant.

âI want to see what the lineup is before I decide,â he told POLITICO.

Hours late, Specter did, joining seven other Republicans in support of the bill: Mississippi Sens. Thad Cochran and Roger Wicker; Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby; Tennessee Sen. Lamar Alexander; Missouri Sen. Kit Bond; Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski and Maine Sen. Olympia Snowe.

The three Democrats opposing were:Sens. Evan Bayh of Indiana; Russ Feingold of Wisconsin and Claire McCaskill of Missouri.

Dear Colleagues,

This is an initiative led by Internet2, National Lambda Rail  
and many others. See the enclosed White Paper.

The "data intensive light paths" and advances in institutional  
infrastructure proposed would be of great benefit to the  
US LHC and other programs in the coming years.

In light of this initiative, and associated discussions, as  
well as the plans for Internet2 to support dynamic circuits  
in support of science, it may be useful for US LHC teams  
to consider attending the next Internet2 meeting.

http://events.internet2.edu/2009/spring-mm/

Rich Carlson of Internet2 is also running a session on Tier3  
experience and needs (Tier2s also can be discussed)  

organized by the High Energy and Nuclear Physics  
Special Interest Group.

Best regards  
Harvey

\*AAAS Policy Alert -- March 4, 2009

\*Budget News \*

FY 2009 Budget Update. Last week the House approved by a vote of 245-178 the fiscal year (FY) 2009 omnibus appropriations bill that would wrap up the 2009 budget for federal agencies operating since last October under a continuing resolution (CR) that expires on Friday, March 6. Included in the omnibus bill is $151.1 billion in federal research and development (R&D), an increase of $6.8 billion or 4.7 percent above the FY 2008 estimate. The Senate will take up the House bill (H.R. 1105) this week, and depending upon the amendments that are allowed on the Senate floor, final appropriations may be ready for the Presidentâs signature by the March 6 deadline. As reported in last weekâs Policy Alert, the omnibus package would include important increases for R&D (separate from the stimulus funds) resulting in a total of $30.3 billion for NIHâs budget; a total of $6.5 billion for NSF of which $5.2 billion would go to Research and Related Activities; $4.8 billion for DOEâs Office of Science; and $17.8 billion for NASA, including $4.5 billion for Science programs. Finally, basic and applied research overall (excluding development) would receive a significant boost, growing 4.3 percent to $60.5 billion and showing an increase for the first time in four years.

FY 2010 Preview. Also last week, the Obama Administration unveiled a budget "outline" for FY 2010 <http://www.info-aaas.org/util/link.jsp?e=59NjMrf6iykdcnOKJtJ8yV0vybECu0nhAfSbmlFAB-TsAfd6ZuijQpszKnWuOmnNS&s=8xRo1EmCpdfNNECFo6Hc2sA..A&v=9NyiitCLY2cPuAd1AOrPwOQ..A>. Although the plan specifically aims to reduce deficit spending over the next five years, with an overall goal of halving the federal deficit by 2013, the 2010 budget plan would include room for some increases in science and technology funding. However, detailed proposals are not laid out for all agencies in the budget released by OMB, and the research community must wait until the detailed FY 2010 budget proposal is released at the end of April. It is important to note that the budget outline uses the FY 2008 funding levels as a baseline for comparing the FY 2010 outlook since the FY 2009 budget is yet to be completed. That said, the overall increase would be largest at EPA, which would receive a total of $10.5 billion, a $3 billion increase above its FY 2008 levels. NSF would receive an overall increase of 16 percent over 2008 funding, for a total of $7 billion. NASAâs budget would grow above 2008 levels by $1.4 billion, for a total of $18.7 billion. Language is included in the plan that states the Administrationâs intention to double funding for basic research over the next 10 years.
