Senate NASA, NSF, NIST Funding Bill; White House Views on House Bill  
  
Later today the Senate Appropriations Committee will meet to review  
and then vote on its version of the FY 2010 Commerce, Justice,  
Science Appropriations Bill, following its approval by the  
subcommittee yesterday.  This bill, a version of which has already  
been passed by the House,  funds the FY 2010 operations of the  
National Science Foundation, NASA, and the National Institute of  
Standards and Technology.  The report accompanying the Senate bill  
containing the all-important report language will not be released  
until after the subcommittee's bill, written by Chairwoman Barbara  
Mikulski (D-MD) with the cooperation of Ranking Member Richard  
Shelby (R-AL), is approved.  Also, last week the Office of  
Management and Budget distributed a Statement of Administration  
Policy.  While OMB said it "strongly supports passage" of the House  
version of the bill, it did find issue with several provisions  
concerning NASA, NSF, and NIST that will be excerpted below.  
  
SENATE APPROPRIATIONS BILL:  
  
The Senate Appropriations Committee issued a three-page summary of  
$64.9 billion legislation. Overall numbers are as follows:  
  
National Science Foundation:  
  
The FY 2009 appropriation was $6,490.4 million.  
The Administration's request was $7,045.0 million, an increase of  
8.5 percent or $554.6 million.  
The House bill provides $6,936.5 million, an increase of 6.9 percent  
or $446.1 million.  
The Senate Appropriations Committee bill would provide a calculated  
$6,916.4 million, an increase of 6.6 percent or $426 million.  
  
NASA:  
  
The FY 2009 appropriation was $17.782 billion.  
The Administration's request was $18.686 billion, an increase of 5.1  
percent or $903.6 million.  
The House bill provides $18.203 billion, an increase of 2.4 percent  
or $420.9 million.  
The Senate Appropriations Committee bill would provide $18.68  
billion, equal to the Administration's request.  
  
National Institute of Standards and Technology:  
  
The FY 2009 appropriation was $819.0 million.  
The Administration's request was $846.1 million, an increase of 3.3  
percent or $27.1 million.  
The House bill provides $781.1 million, a cut of 4.6 percent or  
$37.9 million.  
The Senate Appropriations Committee bill would provide $878.8  
million, an increase of 7.3 percent or $59.8 million.  
  
OMB STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY:  
  
The full three-page statement can be read at  
[http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/assets/sap\_111/](http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/assets/sap_111/)  
saphr2847h\_20090616.pdf (Cut-and-paste both lines of URL.)  Excerpts  
follow:  
  
"The Administration strongly supports passage of H.R. 2847, making  
appropriations for the Departments of Commerce and Justice, and  
Science and Related Agencies for the fiscal year ending September  
30, 2010. 
  
"As we face difficult economic and fiscal decisions, it is important  
to make efficient and effective investments. The bill as considered  
by the Committee makes important investments in innovation and job  
creation, community safety, and cutting-edge technologies. This  
legislation serves as an important piece of the Nation's economic  
recovery and is consistent with the President's commitment to double  
the funding for basic research over ten years.  
  
"The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share  
additional views regarding the Committee's version of the bill."  
  
National Science Foundation:  
  
"The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for the  
President's goal of doubling the NSF budget as a key component of  
his Plan for Science Innovation. However, the Committee's version of  
the bill is $108 million below the level requested in the Budget,  
and this reduction will come at the expense of NSF's research  
activities and agency operations."  
  
National Institute of Standards and Technology:  
  
"The Administration appreciates the Committee's full funding for the  
Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program and the Technology  
Innovation Program but urges the Congress to provide full funding of  
the highest-priority research of the National Institute of Standards  
and Technology (NIST) as part of the President's Plan for Science  
and Innovation. The bill underfunds requested NIST research and  
construction activities by $85 million (13 percent); the bill  
includes $20 million of unrequested funding for construction grants  
that could be better spent on highest-priority research."  
  
NASA:  
  
"The Administration is concerned with the reduction of $670 million  
from the President's FY 2010 request for Exploration Systems. This  
large reduction would likely cause major negative impacts to any  
options that may emerge from the ongoing blue ribbon \[Augustine  
committee\] review of U.S. human space flight plans. The  
Administration appreciates the Committee's strong support for the  
NASA Earth science program, which advances the President's goal of  
deploying a global climate change research and monitoring system.  
The Administration is concerned with the elimination of $21 million  
from the request for NASA innovation, which uses public-private  
partnerships to advance important technologies and enable access to  
new sources of innovation through incentive prizes and partnerships.  
In addition, the Administration is concerned about funding NASA's  
R&D activities with primarily one-year rather than two-year  
appropriations. Such an action would increase the cost and  
complexity of budget execution and would diminish flexibility  
without improving management."

Extract from the AAAS Policy Alert  
  
_**\*Budget News\*  
  
Last week the House of Representatives, by a vote of 259-157, passed the  
Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies (CJS) appropriations  
bill for FY 2010. The legislation (H.R. 2847  
<[http://www.info-aaas.org/util/link.jsp?e=59NjMrf6iykdcnOKJtJ8yVwO-pYsMskPHA0qs23yhAOD\_6CCby1nnd2y5ENCvWHZ8&s=0qmF2-9Ki&v=1VbN81EpoWER4lFc.A](http://www.info-aaas.org/util/link.jsp?e=59NjMrf6iykdcnOKJtJ8yVwO-pYsMskPHA0qs23yhAOD_6CCby1nnd2y5ENCvWHZ8&s=0qmF2-9Ki&v=1VbN81EpoWER4lFc.A)\>)  
includes funding for National Science Foundation (NSF), National  
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the National Institute of  
Standards and Technology (NIST), and the National Oceanic and  
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The measure would provide $6.9  
billion for NSF (7 percent above FY 2009 levels); $18.2 billion for NASA  
(a $421 million increase); $781 million for NIST (a decrease of $57.5  
million), and $4.6 billion for NOAA (a $238 million increase). The White  
House issued a Statement of Administration Policy  
<[http://www.info-aaas.org/util/link.jsp?e=47YNycyl\_p6XJlMxZ4G3rDzMe3cMwYi1gTvSMG7hIJwPHf8Hl&s=0qmF2-9Ki&v=1VbN81EpoWER4lFc.A](http://www.info-aaas.org/util/link.jsp?e=47YNycyl_p6XJlMxZ4G3rDzMe3cMwYi1gTvSMG7hIJwPHf8Hl&s=0qmF2-9Ki&v=1VbN81EpoWER4lFc.A)\>  
expressing concern over reductions (compared with the President's budget  
requests) to programs within all four agencies.  
  
The Senate Appropriations Committee released its 302(b) allocations  
<[http://www.info-aaas.org/util/link.jsp?e=3HAdVkrSLcAEJ1VfAFh0qQB5Oknt9yio-jcu7FGKonsZdF0AM&s=0qmF2-9Ki&v=1VbN81EpoWER4lFc.A](http://www.info-aaas.org/util/link.jsp?e=3HAdVkrSLcAEJ1VfAFh0qQB5Oknt9yio-jcu7FGKonsZdF0AM&s=0qmF2-9Ki&v=1VbN81EpoWER4lFc.A)\>  
for FY 2010, providing that chamber's figures for total discretionary  
spending levels for the federal government, as well as allocations among  
the 12 appropriations subcommittees. Compared to the House 302(b)  
allocations (see last week's Policy Alert), the Senate, in general,  
would provide higher levels for discretionary spending. For example, the  
Senate's recommendation for Commerce, Justice and Science appropriations  
is $64.8 billion, compared to the House level of $64.3 billion.  
  
Both the House and the Senate last week approved the conference report  
<[http://www.info-aaas.org/util/link.jsp?e=2O\_odGyng9kHXsR\_lt2roFsdG4gIM2dTf9Vue1nt5yUuau\_2V&s=0qmF2-9Ki&v=1VbN81EpoWER4lFc.A](http://www.info-aaas.org/util/link.jsp?e=2O_odGyng9kHXsR_lt2roFsdG4gIM2dTf9Vue1nt5yUuau_2V&s=0qmF2-9Ki&v=1VbN81EpoWER4lFc.A)\>  
for the war supplemental appropriation bill, which includes $7.7 billion  
to respond to the swine flu pandemic. A portion of the funds will go  
toward the development and purchase of vaccines, antiviral drugs,  
medical supplies, and diagnostic equipment. Other funds will go for  
upgrading state and local public health capacity and for domestic and  
international surveillance. Of the $7.7 billion, $1.9 billion will be  
available in the current FY 2009 appropriations, while the remainder  
will be held as contingency appropriations. The money is part of the FY  
2009 supplemental appropriation package totaling $106 billion, primarily  
for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The bill now heads to the White  
House, where President Obama is expected to sign it.  
  
The White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued a guidance  
memo  
<[http://www.info-aaas.org/util/link.jsp?e=1G-ss0UhsXlo-1AQMl4hlCDH-xws6Gar5FcdjR1RpbhPgFWFr&s=0qmF2-9Ki&v=1VbN81EpoWER4lFc.A](http://www.info-aaas.org/util/link.jsp?e=1G-ss0UhsXlo-1AQMl4hlCDH-xws6Gar5FcdjR1RpbhPgFWFr&s=0qmF2-9Ki&v=1VbN81EpoWER4lFc.A)\>  
to all federal agencies for preparation of their respective FY 2011  
budgets. All agencies are asked to identify "high-priority performance  
goals," submit recommendations for program terminations and reductions,  
and provide three outlines for a budget request that would reflect (a)  
the estimated level for FY 2011 in the current FY 2010 budget request,  
(b) a freeze at the FY 2010 budget level, and (c) a five percent  
reduction from the estimated FY 2011 level in the current FY 2010 budget  
request.

Math Takes the Lag out of Jet Lag  
_**

  
Researchers at Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Univ. of Michigan have developed a software program that prescribes a regimen for avoiding jet lag using timed light exposure. The method is described in an article published June 19 in the open-access journal **[_PLoS Computational Biology_](http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1000418).**  
  
Traveling across several times zones can cause an individual to experience jet lag, which includes trouble sleeping at night and difficulty remaining awake during the day. These effects largely reflect de-synchronization between the body's internal time clock and local environmental cues.  
  
The program, which seeks to re-synchronize the body with its new environment, considers inputs like background light level and the number of time zones traveled. Then, based on a mathematical model, the program gives users exact times of the day when they should apply countermeasures such as bright light to intervene and reduce the effects of jet lag.  
  
Timed light exposure is a well known synchronization method, and when used properly, this intervention can reset an individual's internal clock to align with local time. The result is more efficient sleep, a decrease in fatigue, and an increase in cognitive performance. Poorly timed light exposure can prolong the re-synchronization process.  
  
Using their computational method, researchers simulated shifting sleep-wake schedules and the subsequent light interventions for realigning internal clocks with local time. They found that the mathematical computation resulted in quicker design of schedules and also predictions of substantial performance improvements. They were able to show that the computation provided the optimal result for timing light exposure to reduce jet lag symptoms.  
  
"Using this computation in a prototyped software application allows a user to set a background light level and the number of time zones traveled to obtain a recommendation of when to expose a subject to bright light, such as the bright lights sometimes used to treat Seasonal Affective Disorder" said lead-author Dennis Dean. "Although this method is not yet available to the public, it has direct implications for designing schedules for jet lag, shift-work, and extreme environments, such as in space, undersea or in polar regions."  
  
"This work shows how interventions can cut the number of days needed to adjust to a new time zone by half," said co-author Daniel Forger.  
  
The next phase of this research includes the addition of interventions such as naps, caffeine and melatonin to help the process of realigning the internal body clock while reducing decreased performance experienced during travel across time zones.

_AIP FYI #78: Statement on Visa Reforms**  
  
FYI  
The American Institute of Physics Bulletin of Science Policy News  
Number 78: June 17, 2009  
Web version: [http://www.aip.org/fyi/2009/078.html](http://www.aip.org/fyi/2009/078.html)  
  
Scientific and Academic Organizations Urge Visa Reforms  
  
Responding to continuing reports about difficulties and delays in  
obtaining visas for study, research, and attendance at  conferences,  
thirty-one scientific and academic organizations have issued a  
statement and set of corrective recommendations.  Among those  
endorsing this statement are the American Institute of Physics and  
five of its Member Societies: Acoustical Society of America,  
American Association of Physics Teachers, American Astronomical  
Society, American Geophysical Union, and American Physical Society.  
  
The below statement was sent to the Office of Science and Technology  
Policy, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of  
State.  A complete list of the endorsing organizations can be viewed  
at [http://www.aip.org/gov/Final%20Visa%20Delay%20Statement.pdf](http://www.aip.org/gov/Final%20Visa%20Delay%20Statement.pdf)  Note  
that a similar statement was issued in May 2005; see  
[http://www.aip.org/gov/commvisa518.pdf](http://www.aip.org/gov/commvisa518.pdf)  
  
  
Statement and Recommendations on Visa Problems Harming America's  
Scientific, Economic, and Security Interests  
  
June 10, 2009  
  
As representatives of organizations of U.S. higher education,  
science, and engineering, we have been deeply concerned about the  
significant increase in delays experienced earlier this year by many  
international students, scholars, and scientists who have applied  
for visas to study, conduct research, or attend conferences in this  
country. Our nation's colleges and universities and scientific and  
technical organizations are the engines of the new knowledge,  
innovation, and advanced training that power the country's research  
enterprise and contribute greatly to economic and national security.  
Moreover, they are important hubs of international scientific and  
technical exchanges, and they play a vital role in facilitating  
educational and cultural interactions that help to spread our  
nation's values.  
  
Lengthy and unnecessary delays frustrate and discourage many of the  
best and brightest international students, scholars, and scientists  
from studying and working in the United States, or attending  
academic and scientific conferences here and abroad. This  
compromises our ability to attract international scientific talent  
and maintain scientific and economic leadership. Given the current  
economic crisis, as delays continue, individuals are more likely to  
decide not to come to the United States.  
  
Our nation needs a visa system that supports international exchange  
and cooperation. We are confident that it is possible to have a  
system that protects national security, and yet is still timely and  
transparent, provides for thorough reviews of applicants, and  
welcomes the finest talent. Scientific exchange and security are not  
mutually exclusive; to the contrary, they complement each other, and  
each is vital to the other.  
  
We applaud this Administration's commitment to restoring America's  
image abroad. We understand that steps currently are being taken to  
increase personnel resources and improve and streamline the visa  
application review process to eliminate the current backlog of  
applications and significantly reduce wait times for prospective  
applicants undergoing Visas Mantis security review. The Department  
of State, Department of Homeland Security, and other partner  
agencies have worked closely with our community in recent years to  
make the visa process less cumbersome, and we are pleased that the  
Administration is taking these additional steps to address some of  
our concerns. It is, therefore, in the spirit of past and future  
cooperation that we offer the following recommendations:  
  
\- Address the current backlog of visa applications as expeditiously  
as possible by providing sufficient resources to the Department of  
State and its partner agencies to allow timely processing of visa  
applications. This action must be taken to prevent the world from  
again believing that the United States does not welcome  
international students, scholars, and scientists.  
  
\-Streamline the visa process for credentialed short-term visitors in  
science and technology fields. A non-immigrant visa applicant who is  
a legitimate graduate student, researcher, or professional in any  
field of science and technology, and whose application is supported  
by a qualified university, scientific body, or corporation should  
receive a determination on his or her visa application within 30  
days. Longer delays are very disruptive to scientific study,  
research and collaborations.  
  
\- Reduce repetitive processing of visa applications for those  
well-known researchers and scholars who regularly visit the United  
States. The Department of State and its partner agencies should  
reduce repetitive reviews of international researchers and scholars  
who regularly travel to the United States to attend academic  
conferences and conduct research. Longer duration clearances and  
visas are needed.  
  
\- Establish protocols to make treatment of applicants more  
consistent. Consular staff at posts abroad should receive regular  
training on protocols for initiating a Visas Mantis review so that  
this screening tool can be used appropriately and consistently.  
Additional training and guidance for consular staff can enhance  
security while simultaneously reducing the number of applications  
submitted for Visas Mantis reviews, thereby alleviating potential  
delays.  
  
\- Provide more transparency in the visa system. We recommend that  
the Department of State provide more transparency for visa  
applicants who experience delays, and establish a special review  
process to address applications pending for more than 30 days.  
  
\- Review and streamline the Technology Alert List (TAL) to include  
only subject areas that clearly have explicit implications for  
national security. The list identifies sensitive areas of science  
and technology in which exports of technology or information might  
be controlled. However, over the years, the TAL has been broadened,  
and it now restrains and inhibits legitimate areas of scientific  
research.  
  
\- Continue and expand ongoing efforts to renegotiate visa  
reciprocity agreements between the United States and key sending  
countries, such as China, to extend the duration of visas each  
country grants students and scholars of the other and to permit  
multiple entries on a single visa. We applaud the Department of  
State's efforts to date in this area and encourage continued  
efforts. Improved reciprocity and allowing multiple entries would  
reduce the number of visa renewals that must be processed.  
  
\- Convene a high level interagency panel to review the full range of  
visa-related policies and procedures put into place after 9/11. Many  
policies and procedures designed to enhance national security were  
put into place after 9/11. An evaluation of their cost-effectiveness  
is needed, and ineffective and unnecessary procedures should be  
revised or eliminated. Such a review would resolve these and other  
outstanding issues.  
  
We appreciate the steps taken recently to improve the visa  
processing system. We reiterate our commitment to work with the  
federal government to address remaining issues and improve the visa  
system further. A system that maintains our nation's security while  
encouraging the entry of the brightest and most qualified  
international students, scholars, scientists, and engineers will  
bolster American scientific and economic competitiveness, as well as  
help restore America's image abroad. We believe that implementing  
the above recommendations will help make this goal a reality.

_AIP FYI #75 -** **FY 2010 House Appropriations Bill: National Science Foundation**  
  
FYI  
The American Institute of Physics Bulletin of Science Policy News  
Number 75: June 15, 2009  
Web version: [http://www.aip.org/fyi/2009/075.html](http://www.aip.org/fyi/2009/075.html) (Recommended)  
  
FY 2010 House Appropriations Bill: National Science Foundation  
  
The report accompanying the House Appropriations Committee version  
of the FY 2010 Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations Bill has  
just been posted.  This report stresses the importance of science  
and technology to the nation, stating in regard to the National  
Science Foundation:  
  
"The value of the NSF to the future growth of the United States  
economy was clearly acknowledged in the National Academy of Sciences  
report Rising Above the Gathering Storm and in the America Competes  
Act (Public Law 110-69). NSF's budget is on course to double by  
fiscal year 2016, and the funding recommended in this bill is  
consistent with this goal."  
  
House Report 111-149 has extensive language regarding the NSF, and  
may be viewed at [http://thomas.loc.gov/home/approp/app10.html](http://thomas.loc.gov/home/approp/app10.html)  The  
following are selections from this committee report.  
  
TOTAL NSF:  
  
The FY 2009 appropriation was $6,490.4 million  
The Administration's request was $7,045.0 million, an increase of  
8.5 percent or $554.6 million.  
The House Appropriations Committee recommended $6,936.5 million, an  
increase of 6.9 percent or $446.1 million.  
  
Most of the reduction in the Administration's request was for  
Research and Related Activities (see below.)  The report stated  
several times that the budget was on track to double, and earlier in  
the report included the following noteworthy language about future  
budget requests and the need to avoid "a boom-bust cycle":  
  
"Continuity in funding levels. - The American Recovery and  
Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) included an additional  
$3,002,000,000 in funding for NSF. Roughly two-thirds of these added  
funds will support 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year research grants, with the  
overwhelming majority of this amount likely going to fund 3-year  
grants, consistent with normal NSF practice. These grants will  
encourage many undergraduate science, engineering, and mathematics  
majors to go to graduate school in their technical fields and will  
support a pulse of research positions employing new graduate degree  
recipients. The budget request projects NSF funding in fiscal year  
2012 of $8,490,000,000. This level is only $1,990,000,000 above the  
base level for fiscal year 2009. The Committee expects future budget  
requests for NSF at least adequate to sustain the levels of science  
workforce supported in fiscal year 2009 by the combined Omnibus  
Appropriations Act, 2009 (Public Law 111-8) and ARRA so as to avoid  
a boom-bust cycle in science, engineering, and mathematics  
employment. It is critical that there be sufficient NSF funding in  
fiscal year 2012 to support opportunities for this pulse of  
additional graduate students and young researchers to continue their  
careers when the 3-year grants funded by ARRA expire.  
  
"The budget request projects NSF funding in fiscal year 2011 of  
$7,250,000,000, which is less than 3 percent above the fiscal year  
2010 request. The Committee finds this level of request inadequate  
given the critical role played by NSF and the Nation's colleges and  
universities. A 7 percent increase, as projected for the annual  
increases in fiscal years 2013-2016, would be more consistent with  
10-year doubling of NSF's budget."  
  
  
RESEARCH AND RELATED ACTIVITIES:  
The FY 2009 appropriation was $5,183.1 million  
The Administration's request was $5,733.2 million, an increase of  
10.6 percent or $550.0 million.  
The House Appropriations Committee recommended $5,642.1 million, an  
increase of 8.9 percent or $459.0 million.  
  
Regarding the $91.0 million reduction from the request, the report  
states: "The reduction recommended from the request for NSF research  
support enables increases in important research and education  
funding in NOAA and NASA."  
  
The report contained the following language:  
  
"Climate change. - All requested increases for climate change in the  
various research programs are supported.  
  
"Graduate research fellows. - The budget request provides funding  
for the selection of 1,654 new fellows in fiscal year 2010. The  
Administration has set a goal of 3,000 new graduate research fellows  
per year by 2013. To accelerate the increase in graduate research  
fellows, the request is increased by $14,010,000 to enable NSF to  
select and support 2,000 new fellows in fiscal year 2010. 
  
"Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).- 
EPSCoR is critical as one means to build science expertise in all  
States. The Committee recommendation includes $147,120,000, the same  
as the request.  
  
"High-risk, High-reward Basic Research. - The Committee supports the  
proposal in the budget request to set aside a minimum of $2,000,000  
in each research division to explore methodologies that support  
transformative research. The Committee understands that this  
initiative will total approximately $92,000,000 Foundation-wide, and  
may include innovative processes for identifying potentially  
transformative research, special solicitations and competitions  
including innovation prizes, increased use of specialized funding  
mechanisms, and exploring novel processes for problem solving.  
  
"Major research instrumentation. - The recommendation includes no  
funds for Major Research Instrumentation. This reduction of  
$100,000,000 from the request recognizes that NSF has issued two  
solicitations during fiscal year 2009 for Major Research  
Instrumentation with awards expected to total $400,000,000. The  
Committee expects the 2011 request again will seek significant funds  
for this important program within Research and Related Activities.  
  
"Materials research. - The request for additional work in Research  
Resources for Materials Research within Mathematical and Physical  
Sciences is not supported in light of the major similar investments  
in basic energy sciences within the Department of Energy Office of  
Science.  
  
"Hydrology and terrestrial ecosystems research. - The Committee  
notes the success of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in  
serving as an institutional focus for atmospheric research and in  
the provision of shared infrastructure, especially supercomputing  
and the community climate model. The Committee sees the need for an  
appropriate mechanism to bring together the hydrology research  
community and better integrate the different types of data and  
observing systems and enhance support of hydrology modeling. The  
Committee also sees the need for an appropriate mechanism to bring  
together the terrestrial ecology research community including the  
existing Long Term Ecological Research sites and their data, the  
considerable efforts in agriculture, forestry, and the USGS  
Biological Research Program, those who use satellite data such as  
that from Landsat, EOS, and the operational NOAA satellites, and the  
new NEON distributed observing system. NSF is directed to report its  
recommendations on the need for and establishment of mechanisms in  
these two areas of research with the budget request for fiscal year  
2011. 
  
"Climate change education. - Using the most current information  
available, the National Academy of Sciences is undertaking a study  
to evaluate the implications of different atmospheric greenhouse gas  
concentration target levels and explain the uncertainties inherent  
in the analyses to inform policy makers as they make decisions about  
stabilization target levels for atmospheric greenhouse gas  
concentrations. Within the amounts appropriated, $100,000 is  
included for transfer to the National Academy of Sciences to develop  
educational materials based on the conclusions of this study for use  
at the collegiate level to strengthen climate education.  
  
"Ocean acidification. - Ocean acidification is a critical problem  
with potentially destructive effects on coral reefs and commercial  
fisheries. Within the amounts appropriated, funding is included for  
research into the causes of and solutions to the growing threat of  
ocean acidification at levels consistent with the recommendations of  
the Federal Ocean Acidification Research and Monitoring Program.  
  
"Metagenomics research. - In environmental research and soil  
science, the new approach of metagenomics, in which genes are  
identified within samples without isolating individual species, is  
of increasing value."  
  
MAJOR RESEARCH EQUIPMENT AND FACILITIES CONSTRUCTION:  
  
The committee provided the requested amounts for Advanced LIGO,  
Atacama Large Millimeter Array, Advanced Technology Solar Telescope,  
Ocean Observatories Initiative, and IceCube.  
  
EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES:  
  
The FY 2009 appropriation was $845.3 million  
The Administration's request was $857.8 million, an increase of 1.5  
percent or $12.5 million.  
The House Appropriations Committee recommended $862.9 million, an  
increase of 2.1 percent or $17.6 million.  
  
The committee recommended the following changes in the budget  
request:  
  
Discovery research K-12:  +$20,000,000  
Research and evaluation on education in science and engineering:  
+$5,000,000  
Course, curriculum and laboratory improvement: +$5,000,000  
STEM talent expansion program: +$2,560,000  
Robert Noyce scholarship program:  +$10,000,000  
Advanced technology education:  -$41,600,000  
Math and science partnership:  +$2,780,000  
Tribal colleges and universities:  +$1,400,000  
  
The report stated:  
  
"Advanced Technology Education. - The recommendation supports  
continuation of all existing grants within the Advanced Technology  
Education Program but does not support any new grants. The Committee  
recommends that future requests for this program of training  
technicians to work in industry be made in more appropriate  
departments or agencies such as the Department of Education.  
  
"K-6 science education. - In testimony before the Commerce, Justice,  
Science Subcommittee, it was stated that most children decide to  
pursue science, engineering or mathematics in elementary school. NSF  
is directed to prepare a report on K-6 science education compiling  
all state standards, evidence of their effectiveness, and the degree  
to which they inculcate scientific inquiry in the education of young  
students. This report is due to the Committees on Appropriations of  
the House and Senate no later than April 1, 2010. NSF is encouraged  
to work with the National Research Council, the National Science  
Teachers Association, and the American Association for the  
Advancement of Science in the preparation of this report and to  
include recommendations for how to improve science education in  
grades K-6. 
  
"Experiential learning. - The Committee strongly believes that  
students need to have experience doing science and not merely  
reading about it. Half a century ago an advantage of U.S. science  
education was the inclusion of laboratory work in high school and  
college science courses. Today, this type of practical student  
experience needs to extend beyond reproducing standard experiments  
to taking measurements where the correct result is not already  
known. Furthermore, it should extend beyond the four walls of a  
physics, chemistry, or biology lab. Opportunities for scientific  
measurement are all around us in the ever changing natural world and  
are simple enough to be accessible even to elementary school  
students with affordable equipment such as thermometers. Such  
hands-on measurement experiences are the central element of  
inquiry-based instruction where students \`do' science: formulating  
research questions, taking measurements, analyzing data using their  
mathematics skills, and articulating their results. It is critical  
that hands-on, inquiry-based instruction form the basis of student  
learning because addressing the complexity and uncertainty inherent  
in current real world problems requires the integrated application  
of all the sciences and mathematics and research shows that this  
improves student achievement and retention. Science literacy for the  
general public and future innovation workforce relies on students  
doing and thinking of how to apply science and math together from  
their earliest years. Accordingly, the Committee recommendation  
provides an increase of $30,000,000 above the request to enhance  
research, implementation and evaluation of inquiry-based, hands-on  
instruction for K-12 science students and those who will teach them.  
  
"Discovery research K-12 (DR-K12). - The increase above the request  
for the DR-K12 program is to enhance advancement of inquiry-based  
instruction in K-12 STEM teaching with at least half the funding  
focused on grades K-6. This may be done through the development,  
implementation, and study of resources, models, and technologies for  
use by students, teachers, and policymakers.  
  
"Research and evaluation of inquiry-based instruction. - The  
increase above the request for the Research and Evaluation on  
Education in Science and Engineering (REESE) program is provided to  
enhance support for empirical research on inquiry-based instruction.  
  
"Inquiry-based undergraduate instruction. - The increase above the  
request is provided to support creation, adaptation, and  
dissemination of learning materials and teaching strategies that  
implement inquiry-based instruction in teaching science to future  
K-12 teachers and other undergraduates and to assess student  
learning and evaluate course effectiveness. Teachers need to  
experience a model of inquiry-based science instruction in order to  
have a model for use of inquiry in their classrooms.  
  
"Hispanic Serving Institutions - Undergraduate Program. - NSF is  
directed to provide a report detailing plans to establish a Hispanic  
Serving Institutions-Undergraduate Program no later than 90 days  
following enactment. The Committee expects a significant funding  
request for such a program to be included in the fiscal year 2011  
budget request for NSF."  
  
An earlier section in the committee report stated: "The Committee  
directs the Foundation to convene a panel of experts to survey U.S.  
pre-K to 12 schools that are highly successful in science,  
technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education and a  
sampling of corresponding institutions abroad and report  
recommendations to Congress on how their STEM education practices  
might be more broadly replicated in the U.S. public school system.  
The membership of the panel should include educators,  
businesspersons, scientists, engineers and others, based on their  
expertise and contributions in the aforementioned fields. The  
Foundation shall submit a report of the findings and recommendations  
of this panel to the Committee within 180 days of the enactment of  
this Act."

WHO raises the Pandemic alert level from Phase 5 to 6**

Since our last update to you, the new Influenza A (H1N1) virus has continued to spread to many more countries and with increasing numbers of people affected. There is verified community spread in multiple locations. The phase change is not a signal that the virus has become more virulent but reflects wider geographic spread. WHO is monitoring the global course of the epidemic and the severity of illness which could change over time and also manifest itself differently in different locations and countries.

WHO is not unduly alarmed as to date, most cases of illness are mild and self limiting and do not require hospitalization.

At this point in time all staff are required to come to work as usual and there is no interruption in ordinary work schedules nor any restriction in travel for CERN staff.  However, we would like to remind you that the most effective way to reduce risk of infection is to practice effective personal hygiene. This includes washing your hands frequently, covering your mouth and nose for coughs and sneezes with a tissue and avoiding close contact with sick people. These measures will help keep people healthy and decrease the number of people around you from becoming ill.  

Ø  **_What are the signs and symptoms of infection?_**

Early signs of Influenza A(H1N1) are flu-like, including fever, cough, headache, muscle and joint pain, sore throat and runny nose, and sometimes vomiting or diarrhoea.

Ø  **_If you do become sick with flu-like symptoms_**, the recommendations made earlier for access to care remain valid for Geneva at this stage, as there is no community transmission identified:  

·         **Stay at home**, limit contact with others.

·         **Staff residing in Switzerland:** contact by telephone your own treating physician giving details of your symptoms. He will evaluate the situation and refer suspect cases to the appropriate health facility for laboratory investigation. For Geneva the referral centre is Hospital Cantonal and for Vaud Canton, the CHUV in Lausanne.

Patients suspected of Influenza A (H1N1) should be isolated at home pending the result of the test (24-48h) and avoid close contacts with others.

Patients with confirmed Influenza A (H1N1) can be treated at home if there is no complication. Isolation is recommended as well as surveillance of very close contacts. According to current Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) and cantonal guidelines, only close contacts will be identified. These are defined as: “people living in the same home as the patient, who shared eating utensils and plates, hugged or kissed or cared for the patient one day before and up to 7 days after onset of symptoms”. They will be informed, receive prevention information on a case-by-case basis (daily fever monitoring for 7 days).

If you cannot reach your private physician or if you do not have one, you may call:

o    Médecins d’urgence: 0041 (0) 22 322 20 20 from 7h00 to 23h, 7d/7

o    Genève Médecins: 0041 (0) 22 754 54 54 , 24h/24h, 7d/7 or

o    SOS Médecins: 0041 (0) 22 748 49 50 24h/24h, 7d/7  

·         **Staff residing in France:** call either your own treating physician for guidance or "15", triage and dispatch centre, for evaluation of the situation, guidance and referral. According to the evaluation of the situation, the patient will be directed, if needed, to the referral hospital which is for both Haute-Savoie and Pays de Gex the hospital of Annecy where the laboratory investigation will be done. NB: Staff living in France, whose treating physicians are in Geneva, may either turn to their treating physician in Geneva or to a doctor at their place of residence.  

·         **On the CERN Site :** go to the CERN infirmary as son as possible (building 57) and outside opening hours call 74444 (the Fire Brigade)

_LP09 - Hamburg, Aug 17-22 - open for direct invitation requests**Dear colleagues,  
  
We are contacting you in your function as speaker of major experiments in High Energy Physics.  
  
As you know the Lepton Photon conference 2009 will take place in Hamburg from August 17-22, 2009. For more details on the conference and the program please visit:  [http://lp09.desy.de](http://lp09.desy.de/)  
  
We like to ask your help in the following two matters:  
  
Traditionally attendance to the lepton photon conference is by invitation only. The list of collegues to be invited is prepared by country contacts. For a number of reasons not all interested people are reached in this way. We therefore would like to open the conference and allow people to directly ask for an invitation at this point in time. To reach the relevant people we would very much appreciate your help in distributing this information to the members of your collaboration. Interested people can simply contact us under  
lp09@desy.de  (this information is also available on the WEB pages : [http://lp09.desy.de)](http://lp09.desy.de%29/) and will receive an invitation. Deadline for registration at the reduced fee is June 30. 
  
In addition to the usual program of plenary talks the conference will also offer the possibility to display a limited number of posters. We like to encourage in particular younger colleagues to present their work and recent results in this way. Posters will be on display throughout the conference. During a dedicated afternoon session the authors of the posters have the opportunity to present them to the conference attendees. We would appreciate very much if you could alert your collegues to this possibility and encourage them to hand in an abstract. Deadline for abstract submission is June 30, and a decision on the accepted posters will be taken shortly thereafter.  
  
With many thanks for your help, and best regards,  
Joachim Mnich, head of the organising comittee LP09**_

**University of Geneva honours LHC project leader at 450th anniversary ceremony**

Geneva, 5 June 2009. The University of Geneva is today holding a ceremony at which honorary degrees will be bestowed on four figures renowned for their activities in bringing nations together, including international collaboration in scientific research at CERN(1)[](https://imapserver3.fnal.gov/frame.html?&security=false&lang=en#_ftn1).   

The ceremony is to celebrate the university’s 450th anniversary.(2)[](https://imapserver3.fnal.gov/frame.html?&security=false&lang=en#_ftn2) The honorary degrees, which recognize endeavours in human rights and in fostering dialogue between nations, are being awarded to Mary Robinson(3)[](https://imapserver3.fnal.gov/frame.html?&security=false&lang=en#_ftn3), Desmond Tutu(4)[](https://imapserver3.fnal.gov/frame.html?&security=false&lang=en#_ftn4), Pascal Lam(5)[](https://imapserver3.fnal.gov/frame.html?&security=false&lang=en#_ftn5) and Lyn Evans.

Lyn Evans led the project to build CERN’s Large Hadron Collider (LHC) from its inception in 1994 until start-up on 10 September 2008. The LHC, which is the world’s highest energy particle accelerator, is the Organization’s latest flagship research facility. It is poised to provide new insights into the mysteries of our universe. Nations from around the globe have contributed to the construction of the accelerator and its experiments.

_“I am very honoured to receive this degree on such an historic occasion and in such esteemed company”_, said Evans. _“The honour extends to the whole team in all corners of the world, who have brought this amazing project to fruition.”_

The ceremony, which is being held in St Peter’s Cathedral in Geneva, begins at 10 am. It will be preceded by a procession in full academic regalia that will include the representatives from Europe’s oldest universities.

Following the welcome from the rector of the University of Geneva, Jean-Dominique Vassalli, there will be a speech from Geneva State Councillor, Charles Beer, a message from Swiss Federal Councillor, Micheline Calmy-Rey, and a talk on the history of the university by honorary professor, Olivier Fatio. After the degree presentations, Pascal Lamy and Desmond Tutu will talk on “Two contrasting visions of human rights and globalization in the 21st century”.
