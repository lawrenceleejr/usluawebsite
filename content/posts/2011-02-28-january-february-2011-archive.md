AAAS Policy Alert - Budget News

Because the final FY 2011 budgets for nearly all federal agencies have not been passed by Congress, the agencies are still operating at FY 2010 budget levels on the basis of a continuing resolution (CR) scheduled to expire on March 4. Meanwhile, the final touches are being put on the President's proposed budget for FY 2012. It will likely be released the week of February 14.
