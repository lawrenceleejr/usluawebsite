##### AIP FYI #36

DOE Undersecretary for Science Steve Koonin refers to "tough choices" in the FY2012  
budget, in areas including high energy physics (up 0.8%) and fusion energy (down 4.5%), during recent  
testimony before Congress.

##### Announcement from KEK director general:

\- all the staff, researchers in KEK were safe.  
\- there was some damages in facilities.  
\- In J-PARC, there was no damage from tsunami, but seems to have  
 significant damages in facilities. Now, it is not permitted to enter.  
\- KEK is now trying to fix the facilities related to lifeline (electricity, water) with highest priority.  
\- KEK staffs are asked to stay at home at least for three days (Mon-Wed).  
\- electricity and water is available in limited places; some areas may not be accessed.

##### Some news on JPARC:

First, all T2K people are accounted for with no injuries reported.

The tsunami did not reach J-PARC itself. J-PARC is protected against 10m high tsunamis, and the local effect was only ~5m.  It was much worse in the region north of the lab, however.

Have not seen any serious structural damage to buildings at J-PARC or in the surrounding towns.  A few buildings have mostly cosmetic damage---damage to siding and such.

Electricity and cell phone coverage is back in Naka, where many T2K people stay, but no running water yet.  The local roads are passable, but the highways are still closed.

We have not had any opportunity to assess the state of the beamline or detectors yet.  Both accelerator people and detector people say that their respective systems shut down "normally" when the earthquake hit, so we don't know of any obvious disasters yet. Certainly there will be a very careful and cautious process of first safety inspections, and then checks of all of the components.

##### AAAS Policy Alert

After passing a two-week continuing resolution (CR) last week that extends funding at FY 2010 levels through March 18 for most of the federal government, Congress begins negotiations on funding for the remainder of FY 2011. The Senate released [its proposal](http://app.aaas-science.org/e/er.aspx?s=1906&lid=1240&elq=a9324051e3484789bbbefe50e7496595) on March 4 as an alternative to the far more stringent [House-passed CR proposal, H.R.1](http://app.aaas-science.org/e/er.aspx?s=1906&lid=1241&elq=a9324051e3484789bbbefe50e7496595).
