_FYI #99: House Debate on DOE Funding Bill**  
FYI  
The American Institute of Physics Bulletin of Science Policy News  
Number 99: July 28, 2009

Excerpts from the House Debate on the FY 2010 DOE Funding Bill  
  
During House consideration of the FY 2010 Energy and Water  
Development Appropriations Bill earlier this month Members discussed  
funding for the DOE Office of Science; the Thomas Jefferson  
Laboratory upgrade; the Energy Innovation Hubs; funding for  
Laboratory Directed Research and Development; and LANSCE, the Los  
Alamos Neutron Science Center.  Selections from the floor debate  
follow:  
  
OFFICE OF SCIENCE FUNDING:  
  
Rep. Judy Biggert (R-IL):  
  
"I rise today in support of the fiscal year 2010 Energy and Water  
Appropriations bill. I want to commend Chairman \[Ed\] Pastor and  
\[Subcommittee\] Ranking Member \[Rodney\] Frelinghuysen and their  
subcommittee for putting together a balanced bill that clearly  
recognizes the importance of scientific research and energy security  
to our Nation's competitiveness.  
  
"There are several provisions of this bill I'm proud to support.  
Chief among those is the increase for the Department of Energy's  
Office of Science. I, along with 70 of my colleagues, asked  
appropriators for an increase consistent with the President's  
request to double the investment in the basic sciences within the  
next decade. The committee provided for $170 million more than the  
fiscal year 2009. This funding is critical to our basic research  
infrastructure and national laboratory work, like that of Argonne in  
my district.  
  
"The innovations and solutions that will enable us to overcome many  
of our greatest challenges from our economic crisis, environmental  
concerns, dependence on foreign energy, and escalating health care  
costs all start with basic research investments.  Economic experts  
have concluded that science-driven technology has accounted for more  
than 50 percent of the growth of the U.S. economy during the last  
half century.  
  
"In recent years, Congress has come to recognize that science will  
be the foundation to address those needs and keep America globally  
competitive. As evidenced by the American COMPETES Act in 2007, both  
Democrats and Republicans support efforts to increase basic research  
in the physical sciences to meet the needs of our growing  
population.  I will insert a copy of our letter in the  
\[Congressional\] Record."  (For more on this letter, see

THOMAS JEFFERSON NATIONAL LABORATORY UPGRADE:  
  
Rep. Bobby Scott (D-VA):  
  
"I, along with my colleague from Virginia \[Rep. Robert Wittman  
(R-VA)\], would like to briefly discuss the importance of fully  
funding the Thomas Jefferson Lab's 12 GeV Upgrade.  
  
"This important project received accelerated funding in the Recovery  
Act. It is vital that this project receive the administration's full  
request of $22 million in this bill. If full funding is not in place  
for the upcoming fiscal year due to stringent controls in how  
Recovery Act funds are spent, there is little flexibility for the  
lab to meet their construction project without costly scheduling  
delays or potential elimination of physics-related work.  I would  
hope that the gentleman from Arizona \[Rep. Pastor\] will work with me  
and Mr. Wittman to ensure that this project is funded at the  
administration's request for fiscal year 2010."  
  
Rep. Wittman:  
  
"I rise in support and to echo the remarks of my colleague from  
Virginia \[Rep. Scott\]. The Thomas Jefferson Lab is a world leader in  
nuclear physics research and education. The lab is currently in the  
midst of a major upgrade to their accelerator facility. Fully  
funding the accelerator upgrade will significantly expand the  
facility's research potential and will lead to a greater  
understanding of atomic particles, the building blocks of all  
matter. Research at Jefferson Lab will continue to expand our  
knowledge of nuclear physics that lead to many exciting scientific  
advances.  I respectfully request that the gentleman from Arizona  
would work to fully fund this important project at Jefferson Lab."  
  
Rep. Pastor:  
  
"I thank the gentleman for bringing this important issue to us.  
You have made a case that the administration request for $22 million  
for the continuous electron beam accelerator facility is merited.  
You have my personal commitment to work with you and Mr. Wittman  
going forward to see that this project receives the funding it needs  
and deserves."  
  
Rep. Scott:  
  
"I thank you for your commitment and thank you for your willingness  
to work on this important issue and thank my colleague from Virginia  
for his support and look forward to working with you in \[the House  
and Senate final appropriations\] conference."  
  
  
ENERGY INNOVATION HUBS:  
  
Rep. Jared Polis (D-CO):  
  
"I, along with my colleague Mr. \[Rep. Russ\] Carnahan \[D-MO\]  rise to  
enter into a \[prearranged conversational\] colloquy.  
  
"Mr. Pastor, several weeks ago the House Sustainable Energy and  
Environment Coalition met with the Secretary of Energy, Steven Chu.  
He shared his vision of eight energy innovation hubs that would  
deliver transformational energy technologies. This bill only funds  
one of those important hubs.  
  
"When these hubs were first discussed with the committee, DOE's  
action plan was not fully developed. Since that time, they have made  
necessary revisions to develop the concept. While we support funding  
only proposals that are fully developed, we hope that you will work  
with the members of the Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition  
and the Department of Energy to continue working to fund this  
initiative as this process continues."  
  
Rep. Carnahan:  
  
"As co-chair of the Congressional High Performance Building Caucus,  
I know firsthand that improvements to our built environment are some  
of the lowest hanging fruit in terms of energy efficiency gains.  
  
"In the long term, we would work with you, Mr. Chairman, to see that  
all eight energy innovation hubs are fully funded. In the short  
term, as we enter into \[the final appropriations\] conference with  
the Senate, we would like to work with you to ensure that the Fuels  
from Sunlight Hub and the Energy Efficient Building Systems Hub are  
fully funded.  I submit for the \[Congressional\] Record letters from  
Members and organizations who also support funding of the energy  
efficient building systems.  I thank you, Mr. Pastor, for your  
willingness to address this issue, and I look forward to working  
with you."  
  
Rep. Pastor:  
  
"First of all, you are both correct in that when the \[Energy\]  
Secretary appeared before the subcommittee, this is and was  
presented as a work in progress. And knowing that we are going to  
proceed forward with the administration and with the Secretary, we  
thought that it was in the best interest to fund one hub. \[see  
[http://www.aip.org/fyi/2009/095.html](http://www.aip.org/fyi/2009/095.html)\] And as the Secretary and the  
administration goes forward in developing these hubs, we look  
forward to working with you."  
  
"So we look forward to working with you and  Mr. Carnahan because  
it's an idea that obviously will expand, will grow, and we want to  
make sure that the committee, the subcommittee has the opportunity  
to work with the Secretary to see its development. So we look  
forward to working with you."  
  
  
LABORATORY DIRECTED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (LDRD):  
  
Rep. Martin Heinrich (D-NM):  
  
"I offer this amendment \[to the Energy and Water Development  
Appropriations Bill\] in strong support of research and development  
at our national laboratories. Specifically, my amendment provides a  
1 percent increase in the Laboratory Directed Research and  
Development, which is commonly referred to as LDRD. LDRD increases  
the ability of laboratories to retain expertise and pursue  
innovative projects by providing additional discretion for  
Department of Energy laboratories to select research activities.  
These high-risk, high-reward projects yield cutting-edge  
advancements in science and technology and produce some of our most  
successful research and development initiatives. These are projects  
with an immediate relevance and a direct impact on national security  
and our goal of energy independence.  
  
"Many LDRD projects have formed the basis of some of the national  
labs' most successful research initiatives.  For example, at Sandia  
National Laboratories in my district, an LDRD researcher developed  
the chemistry for a decontamination foam that is used by our  
military to protect us against chemical and biological attacks. In  
fact, this was the foam that was used to decontaminate the Senate  
Hart Office Building after the anthrax attacks of 2001. We know all  
too well that those who wish our country harm are constantly  
adapting their methods, making these LDRD projects vitally important  
to our national security.  
  
"LDRD is equally relevant to our goal of energy independence. An  
LDRD project developed a manufacturing process that will  
substantially reduce the cost of highly efficient LED light bulbs.  
These LED light bulbs have the potential to decrease electricity  
consumed in lighting by a full 50 percent by 2025. This will  
translate into meaningful cuts in utility bills for our working  
families and real savings for our small businesses. Energy  
independence is a critical element of our national security, and LED  
efficiency will significantly reduce our demand for energy. These  
advancements represent just two examples of the multiple innovative  
science and technology achievements made through LDRD initiatives.  
  
"Under the 2009 Omnibus Appropriations bill, our labs were granted  
authority to use up to 8 percent of their budgets for LDRD  
initiatives, yet the \[FY 2009\]  bill before we today would reduce  
that amount for 2010 to only 6 percent. My amendment would allow our  
labs to dedicate up to 7 percent of their budgets to LDRD. It is  
important to note that my amendment does not require any additional  
spending, as the LDRD funding percentage is derived from the labs'  
overall funding level, nor does my amendment cut any other program.  
Simply put, my amendment encourages innovative research and  
development that will promote our national security and help us to  
reach our goal of energy independence. I urge my colleagues to  
support this amendment."  
  
Rep. Pastor:  
  
"First of all, I'd like to thank the gentleman from New Mexico for  
yielding to me and to inform him that we will support the amendment  
as offered.  However, I have some concerns about increasing the  
percentage of laboratory directed research at this time. I hope that  
this increase in lab directed research and development will, in this  
tight budget environment, produce a net increase in the national  
security output of the laboratories. I look forward to working with  
you to ensure this increase is tightly mission-oriented and will be  
compatible with meeting other challenges of the laboratories.  With  
that, I will inform you that we are supporting this amendment."  
  
Subcommittee Ranking Member Rodney Frelinghuysen (R-NJ):  
  
"I would like to associate my comments with Chairman Pastor. These  
are tight budget times, and I think we worked hard to provide the  
right balance for priorities on our Energy and Water bill. Many of  
us would have liked much more, shall we say, money spent on the  
safety and security of our nuclear weapons stockpile; but quite  
honestly, that was not to be. We all had to compromise, and this  
package is a fair, balanced one.  
  
"A few comments about the LDRD, the Lab Directed R&D programs. These  
programs often allow our laboratories to skirt congressional  
priorities laid out in our legislation. Historically these funds  
have been used by labs to perform research and development on issues  
that at times are not at all germane to the Department of Energy. I  
have seen it firsthand. At the same time, these programs can be most  
innovative and give our researchers creative opportunities for work.  
So I don't oppose the amendment. But I want to make it clear that  
all members of the committee, I am sure, will be watching very  
carefully to ensure that these funds are used to support the mission  
of the department."  
  
Rep. Heinrich:  
  
"I want to add real quickly that the gentleman mentioned our nuclear  
stockpile. One of the other LDRD programs that I think was  
particularly important was the creation and assembly of safety  
devices for our \[nuclear\] stockpile, like the gel mylar capacitors  
that are used in the W76-1. I think the bottom line is that these  
programs represent some of the most cutting-edge research that we  
do. They are critical to our national security. They are critical to  
our energy independence, and I would urge the support of my  
colleagues."  
  
The House approved the amendment by a vote of 424 yes votes, 1  
present, and 14 not voting.  
  
  
LANSCE, THE LOS ALAMOS NEUTRON SCIENCE CENTER:  
  
The Administration requested no funding for LANSCE.  The House bill  
provided no funding.  
  
Rep. Ben Lujan (D-NM)  
  
"I would first like to commend my good friend from Arizona (Rep.  
Pastor) for the strong commitment this bill shows toward shoring up  
both science and the national security of this country. The strong  
support for the Office of Science will be well received in my home  
State of New Mexico.  
  
"I'm seeking the commitment of the gentleman from Arizona to work  
with me on refurbishing LANSCE, the Los Alamos Neutron Science  
Center. This facility plays a crucial role in providing  
one-of-a-kind experimental capabilities to further the lab's science  
mission. In addition, it's a key draw for new scientific talent in  
Los Alamos National Laboratory and high-tech research into northern  
New Mexico. The capabilities resident within the LANSCE facility  
cannot be duplicated in a cost-effective manner anywhere else in the  
country. The investment in the capabilities the refurbishment will  
sustain will pay for itself many times  
over."  
  
Rep. Pastor:  
  
"First of all, I want to thank you for raising this important issue,  
and you have my personal commitment to work with you as we go  
forward to find a solution that best serves the national security.  
We're well aware of the capabilities and the value of Los Alamos  
National Laboratories."  
  
Rep. Lujan:  
  
"Again, I would like to commend my friend, the gentleman from  
Arizona for this legislation, and I thank him for his willingness to  
work with me on this important issue."

The American Institute of Physics Bulletin of Science Policy News Number 92: July 14, 2009 Web version: [http://www.aip.org/fyi/2009/092.html](http://www.aip.org/fyi/2009/092.html)

New Director of the DOE Office of Science Addresses Advisory Committee

William Brinkman, the new Director of the Department of Energy's Office of Science had been in his new position for about two weeks when he appeared before the Basic Energy Sciences Advisory Committee on July 9.  Brinkman spoke to the committee for about 40 minutes, describing DOE's science programs, the FY 2010 request, and his perspectives on several key issues.  His presentation focused on the Office of Science's three overarching themes: science for national needs, science for discovery, and national scientific user facilities.  Among the topics he discussed were:

USER FACILITIES:

When commenting on DOE's user facilities, Brinkman said Fermilab's Tevatron will be kept in operation until the Large Hadron Collider "really starts doing things."  In discussing ITER, he told the committee that it was both a fusion experiment and an experiment in international partnerships.  Brinkman described his pride in the large numbers of users for the department's scientific facilities - especially the light sources.  He wants to increase the number of users of the department's nanoscale facilities.

OUTLOOK ON FY 2010 AND 2011 BUDGET REQUESTS:

"A good substantial increase" is how Brinkman described the FY 2010 request.  He told the committee he did not know what the outlook was for the FY 2011 Office of Science budget request, adding that President Obama has pledged to double its funding.  DOE support for education programs should increase.

ENERGY INNOVATION HUBS:

House and Senate appropriators did not provide funding in their versions of the FY 2010 bills to launch all eight Energy Innovation Hubs.  Brinkman predicted that the program would start slowly, and grow in future years.

NUCLEAR ENERGY:

Regarding nuclear energy, Brinkman spoke of the need to consider the entire fuel cycle, and of the "very big challenge" in arriving at a solution for nuclear waste.

BALANCING SPENDING:

Brinkman said there was "a fairly decent balance between energy and research," adding that the 40 percent now spent on research was "fairly reasonable."  More thought needs to be given, he told the committee, to strengthening science for national needs.

ENERGY AND CLIMATE CHANGE:

Brinkman described how the public's attitude has evolved, with many people now firmly in support of doing something about energy problems, and the need to transition from carbon-based sources.

Doing so would reduce the need to find ways to control greenhouse gas emissions.

BASIC RESEARCH:

 Brinkman's final comments concerned the importance of basic research.  A major challenge to the research community will be responding to national needs for new energy technologies, while ensuring the continuation of basic research.  We "do not want to kill off" basic research in the search for new energy technologies, he told the committee, saying that it was DOE's responsibility to support basic research.

The committee report stated:  
  
"By utilizing the Department's intellectual and physical assets to  
provide teachers with the opportunity to become teacher-scientists  
rather than teachers who happen to teach science, this program can  
significantly enhance the ability of teachers to involve their  
students in doing science rather than just reading about and  
reproducing well-established principles."  
  
  
ARPA-E  
  
The Administration requested $10.0 million for the Advanced Research  
Projects Agency - Energy, the first budget request for ARPA-E.  
  
The Senate appropriations bill provided no funding, without comment.  
  
House appropriators did not provide funding, the committee report  
stating:  
  
"The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act provided $400 million  
for the establishment of the Advanced Research Projects  
Agency--Energy (ARPA-E). The Committee believes that, in addition to  
the fiscal year 2009 appropriation of $15,000,000 (for program  
direction), this funding will allow ARPA-E to fund its first round  
of projects beginning in fiscal year 2010 and provides an  
appropriate foundation of project funding as ARPA-E ramps-up to full  
operation. The decision not to provide any additional funding for  
ARPA-E in fiscal year 2010 beyond the funding already provided does  
not in any way suggest a lack of commitment to this new program by  
the Committee. The Committee looks forward to ARPA-E becoming fully  
operational in fiscal year 2010 and beginning its important work of  
developing innovative and transformational energy technologies.  
  
"The initial staffing and leadership of ARPA-E will be critical to  
its long-term success. While the Committee commends the Department  
for moving quickly on the establishment of ARPA-E, there is concern  
that the timeline dictated by the agency's Funding Opportunity  
Announcement may outpace the selection of the Program Managers and a  
Director or an acting Director, as intended in the America COMPETES  
Act. The Committee encourages the Secretary to use all existing  
authorities to aggressively recruit staff that will be uniquely  
qualified to both make project funding decisions and create a  
distinct organizational culture for ARPA-E."

_News on the LHC  
  
**The foreseen shutdown work on the LHC is proceeding well, including the  
powering tests with the new quench protection system. However, during  
the past week vacuum leaks have been found in two "cold" sectors of the  
LHC. The leaks were found in sectors 8-1 and 2-3 while they were being  
prepared for the electrical tests on the copper stabilizers at around 80  
K. In both cases the leak is at one end of the sector, where the  
electrical feedbox, DFBA, joins Q7, the final magnet in the sector.  
  
Unfortunately, the repair necessitates a partial warm-up of both  
sectors. This involves the end sub-sector being warmed to room  
temperature, while the adjacent sub-sector "floats” in temperature and  
the remainder of the sector is kept at 80 K. As the leak is from the  
helium circuit to the insulating vacuum, the repair work will have no  
impact on the vacuum in the beam pipe. However the intervention will  
have an impact on the schedule for the restart. It is now foreseen that  
the LHC will be closed up and ready for beam injection by mid-November.

The American Institute of Physics Bulletin of Science Policy News  
Number 92: July 14, 2009  
Web version: [http://www.aip.org/fyi/2009/092.html](http://www.aip.org/fyi/2009/092.html)  
  
New Director of the DOE Office of Science Addresses Advisory  
Committee  
  
William Brinkman, the new Director of the Department of Energy's  
Office of Science had been in his new position for about two weeks  
when he appeared before the Basic Energy Sciences Advisory Committee  
on July 9.  Brinkman spoke to the committee for about 40 minutes,  
describing DOE's science programs, the FY 2010 request, and his  
perspectives on several key issues.  His presentation focused on the  
Office of Science's three overarching themes: science for national  
needs, science for discovery, and national scientific user  
facilities.  Among the topics he discussed were:  
  
USER FACILITIES:  
  
When commenting on DOE's user facilities, Brinkman said Fermilab's  
Tevatron will be kept in operation until the Large Hadron Collider  
"really starts doing things."  In discussing ITER, he told the  
committee that it was both a fusion experiment and an experiment in  
international partnerships.  Brinkman described his pride in the  
large numbers of users for the department's scientific facilities - 
especially the light sources.  He wants to increase the number of  
users of the department's nanoscale facilities.  
  
OUTLOOK ON FY 2010 AND 2011 BUDGET REQUESTS:  
  
"A good substantial increase" is how Brinkman described the FY 2010  
request.  He told the committee he did not know what the outlook was  
for the FY 2011 Office of Science budget request, adding that  
President Obama has pledged to double its funding.  DOE support for  
education programs should increase.  
  
ENERGY INNOVATION HUBS:  
  
House and Senate appropriators did not provide funding in their  
versions of the FY 2010 bills to launch all eight Energy Innovation  
Hubs.  Brinkman predicted that the program would start slowly, and  
grow in future years.  
  
NUCLEAR ENERGY:  
  
Regarding nuclear energy, Brinkman spoke of the need to consider the  
entire fuel cycle, and of the "very big challenge" in arriving at a  
solution for nuclear waste.  
  
BALANCING SPENDING:  
  
Brinkman said there was "a fairly decent balance between energy and  
research," adding that the 40 percent now spent on research was  
"fairly reasonable."  More thought needs to be given, he told the  
committee, to strengthening science for national needs.  
  
ENERGY AND CLIMATE CHANGE:  
  
Brinkman described how the public's attitude has evolved, with many  
people now firmly in support of doing something about energy  
problems, and the need to transition from carbon-based sources.  
Doing so would reduce the need to find ways to control greenhouse  
gas emissions.  
  
BASIC RESEARCH:  
  
Brinkman's final comments concerned the importance of basic  
research.  A major challenge to the research community will be  
responding to national needs for new energy technologies, while  
ensuring the continuation of basic research.  We "do not want to  
kill off" basic research in the search for new energy technologies,  
he told the committee, saying that it was DOE's responsibility to  
support basic research.

\*Dont be shy about writing your own letter!  
\*Tell your own story.  Just remember to keep it to a page in length, and  
make sure your purpose is stated clearly in the first paragraph:  
  I urge Senator\_\_\_\_ to support a Medicare Demonstration Project in Mexico,  
in order to save Medicare program costs and provide seniors living in Mexico  
with the benefits for which they have paid  
\*  
If you have trouble using any of these files, or would like help writing a  
letter please send us an email at info.aca@gmail.com - one of our volunteers  
will answer your request.\*  
  
\*Some Background\*  
  
Demonstration Projects are the limited-scale experiments that Medicare  
undertakes to test innovations in Medicare Program design.  Demonstration  
Projects are aimed at reducing costs, improving health outcomes, increasing  
Program efficiency, or decreasing bureaucracy and streamlining  
administration.  Medicare does not make large Program changes without first  
conducting a Demonstration Project.  
  
Medicare legislation provides authorization for Demonstration Projects to be  
developed and implemented within the U.S., but not in foreign countries.  
Congressional authorization and waivers of a number of provisions in the  
Medicare legislation will be required in order to implement a Demonstration  
Project for seniors living in Mexico.  
  
At Americans for Medicare in Mexico, A.C., we believe that a Demonstration  
Project for Medicare in Mexico will prove to be successful on a number of  
levels:  
1.    Medicare Program savings will result, thanks to significantly lower  
health care costs in Mexico.  
2.    Improved health outcomes for seniors living in Mexico, who are likely  
to access care earlier when symptoms arise, and to have more frequent  
preventive examinations and care, thanks to having coverage where they live.  
3.    Stimulate and enhance improvements already underway in certain sectors  
of the Mexican health provider industry.  
  
Now is the best opportunity ever to bring Medicare services to eligible  
retirees living in Mexico.  This is due to a confluence of political and  
economic events in the United States and Mexico.  The current focus on  
healthcare reform in the U.S. provides an opportunity to promote Medicare  
Demonstration Projects generally, as the need to find Medicare Program cost  
savings becomes more urgent each year. A Medicare Demonstration Project in  
Mexico will save the Medicare Trust Fund a large sum, thanks to much lower  
cost for health services in Mexico.  
  
According to most estimates, there are up to 200,000 American seniors, 60+  
years young, living in Mexico either full or part time.  These individuals  
are mostly retired, and have worked in the U.S. for an average 31 years,  
paying into the Medicare system.  Because they live in Mexico, they either  
do not have access to the services for which they have paid, or they must  
travel back to the U.S. for covered medical care.  
And in fact, a survey on the issue found that while most expat seniors  
living in Mexico pay out-of-pocket for doctor visits, labs, and  
prescriptions, \*64% either have, or would travel back to the U.S. for a  
serious illness requiring hospitalization or extended care\* not because of  
concern about the care available in Mexico, but because they have coverage  
in the U.S.  If they had coverage for preventive care and doctor visits in  
Mexico (Medicare Part B), at least some of that high-cost hospitalization  
would be avoided saving even more money, and improving health outcomes.  
  
Many seniors choose Mexico in part for the lower cost of livingthe median  
household income for this group is only about $35,000.  That amount doesnt  
go far in most US cities, but you can live reasonably well in Mexico on that  
amount.  
  
Imagine having a serious illness, a limited budget, and having to travel to  
the U.S. to receive covered care.  Thats the reality for many expat seniors  
in Mexico.  
  
\*Please write today\*.  Eligible seniors living in Mexico need your support.  
Its fair, will improve health for a vulnerable population, and it will save  
our government money.  What could be better legislation?
