EPP Funding Plans FY09 to FY11  
  
_**

          We would like to give you an update regarding EPP “normally appropriated” (NA) funding and the use of the special ARRA funds.  In addition we would like to alert you to special funding opportunities in the ARRA MRI and ARI solicitations. . Details of these solicitations can be found at

Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI-R²)

[http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm\_summ.jsp?pims\_id=5260](http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5260)

Full Proposal Deadline Date: August 10, 2009

Academic Research Infrastructure Program: Recovery and Reinvestment (ARI-R²)

[http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm\_summ.jsp?pims\_id=503380&org=NSF&sel\_org=XCUT&from=fund](http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503380&org=NSF&sel_org=XCUT&from=fund)

Letter of Intent Deadline Date: July 1, 2009

Full Proposal Deadline Date: August 24, 2009

        Under guidelines set by the National Science Foundation the EPP ARRA funds are used only for standard grants that had undergone the standard review process and were to be recommended for an award. In addition, proposals funded with ARRA funds cannot be awarded supplemental funds during the duration of the grant.

Consistent with NSF guidance, we plan to use ARRA funds to support appropriate merit reviewed proposals that have requested funding in FY 09, 10 and 11. As a consequence, and depending on sustained NA funding, we should have more NA funding available than would otherwise be the case in these years. The bulk of this available NA funding will enhance support through our normal funding process. With the aid of the ARRA funds, once the final determination is made for the amount needed to fund the remaining active research proposals, EPP will be able to consider limited supplemental funding actions using NA funds. Some supplemental awards will address prior commitments. Priority consideration will be given to those grants that were made in FY08 and were reviewed as meriting funding that could not be realized but had to accept a significant decrease compared to their FY07 funding.

We at EPP are grateful for the ability to better advance our science and infrastructure through ARRA funding

FYIThe American Institute of Physics Bulletin of Science Policy NewsNumber 67: May 22, 2009Web version: http://www.aip.org/fyi/2009/067.htmlEnergy Secretary Chu Testifies Before Senate AppropriatorsEnergy Secretary Steven Chu was the only witness at a ninety-minutehearing held by the Senate Energy and Water DevelopmentAppropriations Subcommittee earlier this week.  Chu, testifying onthe FY 2010 Department of Energy request, was well-received,although he encountered some skepticism about aspects of thedepartment's proposed budget.Chairman  Byron Dorgan (D-ND) opened the hearing by commenting onhow the department's $27.1 billion request was basically flat ascompared to this year's appropriation.  Dorgan characterized theOffice of Science request as  "robust," and described the proposedEnergy Innovation Hubs in favorable terms.  The subcommittee'sRanking Republican, Robert Bennett (R-UT), suggested that the Officeof Management and Budget had influenced the preparation of therequest, warning that a chronic pension shortfall for some DOEworkers threatened funding for science and weapon facilities'cleanup programs.   Bennett also seemed to question the ability ofthe Office of Science to promptly spend its $1.6 billion in economicstimulus funding, saying that it "can only shovel so much money outthe door."Chu briefly summarized his written testimony, explaining that therequest emphasized science, discovery and innovation.  He told thecommittee he wants to better utilize basic research supported by theOffice of Science to maximize energy breakthroughs, emphasizing  theproposed Energy Innovation Hubs and their work in areas such asartificial photosynthesis or better batteries.Many of the questions addressed to Chu focused on research areasthat senators felt had been inadequately funded.  Chairman Dorganargued that flat funding for coal R&D was unwise, and took realissue with what he called the near zeroing out of funding forhydrogen research.  He criticized how the department's proposalwould end funding for 500 jobs in universities, nationallaboratories, and industry.   Calling himself a "big fan" ofhydrogen and fuel cells, he acknowledged that while theirutilization would not occur in the near term, it was the mission ofDOE to pursue such long-term research.  Chu responded that it was adifficult decision and spoke of problems in the compact storage ofhydrogen for use in vehicles, the use of reformulated natural gas asits source, and supply infrastructure obstacles.   Dorgan replied hewould not support shutting down hydrogen research and that thesubcommittee would do everything it could to continue it.Dorgan also asked about the status of the panel to developalternatives to the storage of radioactive waste.  Chu said a listof names was now circulating in the White House, and spoke of hissupport for interim storage and the eventual reprocessing of spentfuel, adding during later questioning that he thought "the wasteproblem is solvable."Ranking Member Bennett asked additional questions about how quicklyDOE would spend  its economic stimulus funding.  Chu said thedepartment hopes to obligate 70 percent of this funding by LaborDay, saying there would be a "massive review" of many programs thissummer.  He called this process a "herculean task" that wouldinvolve many reviewers coming to Washington for a week this summer.Other questions addressed to Secretary Chu involved innovative usesof CO2,  proposed solar facilities on desert lands in California,the clean up of World War II and Cold War facilities, new storagefacilities for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the potential ofgeothermal and wind energy, weatherization, and proposedrequirements for renewal energy production.In a related development, the Senate confirmed Under Secretary forScience Steven Koonin this week.  Koonin was previously the ChiefScientist for BP, following twenty-nine years at the CaliforniaInstitute of Technology where he was a Professor of TheoreticalPhysics and the Institute's Provost.

On May 18 the U.S. Senate approved the nomination of Margaret Hamburg as commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration.  
  
National Climate Service Bill Advances. On May 13, the House Science and Technology Subcommittee on Energy and Environment passed a [draft bill](http://www.info-aaas.org/util/link.jsp?e=9hkWtoeqjSJbw-2wNomQH2e6Tj2A8LVaxjoSNkjdIK4816uHOrGIlBOIbtg-JTN0v&s=2a6JKES7m&v=3UlsClrqMdxJL) that would create a National Climate Service within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Sponsored by Committee Chairman Bart Gordon (D-TN), the proposal would expand NOAA's delivery of climate-oriented services and is envisioned as a single point of federal contact for data collection, information exchange, climate forecasting, and adaptation assistance. The bill establishes a network of regional and local facilities to enhance collaboration, including the six preexisting [Regional Climate Centers](http://www.info-aaas.org/util/link.jsp?e=8b-GV3JGbMHd3PssHSnp4aRKMuUxZlMI67wOsTGNx-_8ftdAXDI5Xo832c3kYFHMx&s=2a6JKES7m&v=3UlsClrqMdxJL), facilities run by the [National Weather Service](http://www.info-aaas.org/util/link.jsp?e=7m05EBfGhHdS0bmlwPqDN7JXqce8f5M0li0LlWI3_U_AGCNAECInIuD8w27YEtIHk&s=2a6JKES7m&v=3UlsClrqMdxJL), and other NOAA programs. The full committee is scheduled to take up the bill later this week.  
  
Boxer/Inhofe Climate Bill Approved by Committee. The Senate Environment and Public Works passed a bill cosponsored by Chair Barbara Boxer (D-CA) and Ranking Member James Inhofe (R-OK) on May 14. The Black Carbon Emissions Bill (S. 849) requires the EPA to study the climate and health-related impacts of black carbon and to identify the most effective control strategies for the pollutant, a contributor to global warming that is mainly emitted from diesel engines and burning wood.  
  
Committee Begins Markup of Climate Bill. The House Energy and Commerce Committee began markup of the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 (H.R. 2454) on Monday. Chairman Henry Waxman (D-CA) and Energy and Environment Subcommittee Chair Ed Markey (D-MA) released the [bill's text](http://www.info-aaas.org/util/link.jsp?e=6isk9LxiL1JpBWJFMOUpopHmUJa66RFAO9JQ4zBCdtgzPuZ3A6oeF4GEattPoRzBq&s=2a6JKES7m&v=3UlsClrqMdxJL) late last week. The bill contains several changes from an earlier draft, notably reducing the greenhouse gas emissions goal in 2020 from 20 to 17 percent below 2005 levels and lowering a renewable electricity standard from 25 percent in 2025 to 20 percent, with a quarter of that total allowable from increased efficiency measures. The bill outlines how [emission allowances](http://www.info-aaas.org/util/link.jsp?e=59NjMrf6iykdcnOKJtJ8yVz7uQUoeYI8zzjQYSr_dUU8LayrTDcRx3mPR6qNr0uYA&s=2a6JKES7m&v=3UlsClrqMdxJL) and revenues will be distributed, with utilities receiving 35 percent of the free permits and trade-vulnerable industries such as steel, cement and glass receiving 15 percent.

NIH Deals with Grant Overload, Conflict of Interest. The National Institutes of Health is reportedly overwhelmed by the submission of approximately 20,000 Challenge Grant applications-more than double the amount for a normal review period. NIH must award the grants by the end of September, and so it has recruited more than 15,000 extra reviewers and will take an editorial board-style approach. In other news, NIH is examining its financial conflict of interest policies following a number of high-profile incidents involving extramural researchers. [Comments](http://www.info-aaas.org/util/link.jsp?e=0-jkh8dWkT3n-qkJdT6KB-x1pYz642-eOhP3bpM0OixgSfhu9&s=2a6JKES7m&v=3UlsClrqMdxJL) are due by July 7. 
  
USDA and Animal Welfare. On March 17, 2009, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) inspected the University of Louisiana's New Iberia Research Center (NIRC) following complaints by the Humane Society of the United States that the center was caring for its nonhuman primates in a manner that violated the Animal Welfare Act requirements. Inspectors cited NIRC for issues with its handling of animals, and with its Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). A USDA follow-up inspection on April 30, however, concluded that the March 17 citations were being addressed appropriately.  
  
"Midnight Regulation" Affirmed. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar has [announced](http://www.info-aaas.org/util/link.jsp?e=8b-GV3JGbMHd3PssHSnp4aRKMuUxZlMI67wOsTGNx-__RnEMq8Gl6dRXik1Dvegsi&s=2a6JKES7m&v=3UlsClrqMdxJL) that the administration will retain a special rule issued in December for protecting the polar bear under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The rule prohibits the government from invoking the Act to restrict emissions of greenhouse gases that threaten polar bears and their habitats. Salazar told the [New York Times](http://www.info-aaas.org/util/link.jsp?e=7m05EBfGhHdS0bmlwPqDN7JXqce8f5M0li0LlWI3_U_DIfAeE-Q587_dii53eFYwI&s=2a6JKES7m&v=3UlsClrqMdxJL) that ESA is not the appropriate means for curbing emissions linked to global warming.  
  
NSF Data on Doctorates to Underrepresented Minorities. NSFs Science Resources Statistics Division established a new [Web site](http://www.info-aaas.org/util/link.jsp?e=6isk9LxiL1JpBWJFMOUpopHmUJa66RFAO9JQ4zBCdtgwj7cvLsEiZ-hS1Wft_09Zd&s=2a6JKES7m&v=3UlsClrqMdxJL) that provides information on its progress toward improving the release of doctorate recipient data of underrepresented minorities as part of the annual Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED). Concerns arose in the past over the suppression of data disaggregated by race/ethnicity/sex that, although critical for programs and policies to promote underrepresented minorities, could reveal personal information of the surveyed individuals due to the small sample size. Current plans, however, now will release the data while protecting confidentiality.

AAAS Submits Comments on Scientific Integrity. On May 13, AAAS [responded](http://www.info-aaas.org/util/link.jsp?e=59NjMrf6iykdcnOKJtJ8yVz7uQUoeYI8zzjQYSr_dUU8-Aa35Uhl1Q9iFjJyuJn3T&s=2a6JKES7m&v=3UlsClrqMdxJL) to the Office of Science and Technology Policy's (OSTP) request for public comment on the Presidential Memo on Scientific Integrity published in the Federal Register on April 23, 2009. 
  
NRC Issues Report on Neuroscience and the Military. A new report from the National Research Council (NRC) states that the Army should use insights from neuroscience to improve its capacity to identify and make use of the individual variability of its soldiers. The report, [Opportunities in Neuroscience for Future Army Applications](http://www.info-aaas.org/util/link.jsp?e=47YNycyl_p6XJlMxZ4G3rDzMe0cQ1Yi1gTvSMG7hIJAbNcMbg&s=2a6JKES7m&v=3UlsClrqMdxJL), says the Army should expand its research on the neural bases of training, learning and performance, and should monitor nonmilitary research in neuroscience to keep abreast of advances that may have military application. Neuroscience also may have practical battlefield applications, the report said, such as neuroergonomics -- the use of brain-machine interfaces to allow hands-off control of external systems such as computers or vehicles.

International Travel Grant Award Program  
_**

```
Message to the members of the American Physical SocietyForum on International Physics. Authorized by Noemi Mirkin,Secretary/Treasurer.***********************************************************Dear FIP members:I want to bring to your attention the call for applicationsfor the tenth competitive cycle of the INTERNATIONAL TRAVELGRANT AWARD PROGRAM. Below are the details of the program andinstructions for applying online. You will also find thisinformation on the FIP website:   http://www.aps.org/units/fip/ Sincerely,Noemi Mirkin*************************************************************************         INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL GRANT AWARD PROGRAM (ITGAP)I. BackgroundFollowing the initiative of the APS Forum on International Physics (FIP), the sponsors* of the APS International Travel Grant Award Program (ITGAP) recognize that funding for collaborations between developed and developing country scientists is often insufficient to meet existing needs and opportunities. While the needs are great, and though we have only limited resources to stimulate growth of longer-term collaborations, we believe that an International Travel Grant Award Program, even a modest one, may make a significant difference.* ITGAP sponsors: APS Divisions of Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics (DAMOP), Astrophysics (DAP), Computational Physics (DCOMP), Materials Physics (DMP), Nuclear Physics (DNP), Physics of Beams (DPB), Particles and Fields (DPF), and Plasma Physics (DPP), the APS Forum on International Physics (FIP), the APS Topical Group on Magnetism and its Applications (GMAG), the APS Office of International Affairs, and the U.S. Liaison Committee for the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics.II. PurposePromote international scientific collaborations between APS members and physicists in developing countries.III. Amount of the AwardUp to US$2,000 for travel and lodging expenses for international travel while visiting a collaborator.IV. FeaturesA. Time limit: Once awarded, the time limit on the use of the award is a    maximum of 5 years.B. Report: A report, with a 300 word public abstract, is required upon    completion of the award. This report will be posted on APS websites.C. Bi-directionality: The trip can be in either direction, with preference    given for travel from developing countries to developed countries.D. Preference: Support for the growth of existing collaborations will be    given preference over new ones, a measure of the former, for example,    being joint publications.V. Conditions and CriteriaA collaborative visit must be for a period of at least one month. One or both partners (co-applicants) in the collaboration must be APS members of at least one of the sponsoring APS units. When rank-ordering applications, consideration will be given to:A. Merit1. Past record of research accomplishments and promise of future    accomplishments; and2. Invited talks to be delivered during the trip, especially talks at    APS-sponsored meetings.B. Need1. Under-represented countries and ethnic groups will be given priority; and2. Resources available from other sources with matching funds (leverage)    will be considered as a positive factor while potential support    available, but not sought, from other sources as a negative factor.VI. ProgramAwards will be made on 6-month competitive cycles. Twenty awards have been made during the first nine cycles. The application deadline for the current (10th) cycle is 30 June 2009. Decisions will be announced 31 July 2009. Applications are to be submitted online at      http://ultron.aps.org/forms/aps.cgi?ID=1028 They should include the following items:Narrative proposal of 5000 characters (maximum);Lists of up to 5 most relevant publications of the two co-applicants;Statement of financial support provided from an appropriate representative of other sources (leverage);Statement of who is (are) the member(s) of the APS sponsoring units (specifying all that apply, i.e., DAMOP, DAP, DCOMP, DMP, DNP, DPB, DPF, DPP, FIP, or GMAG);Outline of the benefits of the proposal to junior scientists, students, or post-docs from a developing country; andDescription of the travel plan and budget.Applications will be considered active for the current cycle alone without restricting re-application in subsequent cycles. The Executive Committee of FIP, with assistance from the APS Committee on International Scientific Affairs (CISA), the APS Office of International Affairs, and other sponsoring APS units, will be responsible for managing the review process. Confidentiality of the reviews is assured.VII. Longer-term ProgramFIP and CISA invite funding partners to either continue this program or co-develop new programs that meet our combined  objectives. We especially seek support of additional APS Units. Larger  awards with broader aims and relaxing the restriction on APS membership are anticipated.VIII.

_Please note that the Delegates to the CERN Council were informed this morning of this decision by the Council secretariat._

_Official confirmation of Austria’s decision should be received this afternoon._

_Apologies for the misunderstanding._

­­­­­- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Yesterday afternoon, Austrian Federal Chancellor Werner Faymann announced that Austria will not be leaving CERN. I am very pleased that Austria has taken this decision, and convinced that it is the right one not only for Austrian science, but also for European science. In taking this step, Chancellor Faymann is reaffirming Austria's commitment to European research, and ensuring that the Austrian particle physics community can celebrate the 50th anniversary of Austrian accession to CERN, safe in the knowledge that Austria will play a full part in reaping the rewards of LHC physics.  

Official confirmation of Austria’s decision was received this morning by letter from the Austrian Mission in Geneva to the President of the CERN Council.

While the FY2010 budget is somewhat flatter than the 7+ % increase per year  
required for doubling over ten years, the outlook is for the  
upward trend to pick up in the future. This year it is important to  
stay on track, with the President's request, and to keep the pressure up  
for continued strong support in the future.  
  
Best regards

Re:   Support for President Obama.s Fiscal Year 2010 Request for the  
       Department of Energy Office of Science  
  
I am writing to request that you contact your Senators no later than  
Friday, May 22, 2009 and ask that they sign a letter being  
circulated by Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairman  
Jeff Bingaman and Senator Lamar Alexander to the Appropriations  
Committee supporting President Obama's Fiscal Year 2010 request of  
"at least $4.9 billion" for the Department of Energy Office of  
Science (DOE/SC).  Securing this amount would largely keep DOE/SC  
on the seven year doubling plan set out by the America COMPETES Act  
of 2007 (P.L. 110-69).  Despite recent increases in funding for  
DOE/SC through the FY2009 budget and the President's American  
Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), it is critical to keep  
the pressure on Congress to continue strong and steady increases in  
basic science funding and to avoid the "boom and bust" cycle in such  
funding in future years.  You can make this contact quickly and  
easily at:

There, you will find pre-written messages to your Senators. You may  
send these letters as they are, modify them, or write your own.  
While individualizing your letter is not essential, please at least  
make minor edits to the subject line and the first line of the text  
of each email so that these emails are more individualized.  (See

Foreign Driving Licenses in France  
  
_**An article published in a January 2009 issue of the CERN Bulletin titled "Foreign Driving Licenses in France" may resolve questions some holders of U.S. licenses have about whether or not they need to obtain a French driving license if living at CERN for more than one year. Section 1.2.a. of the article, for holders of a driving license issued by a non-EU, non-EEA country, states that "Any driving licence held by a person who is in possession of a special residence permit issued by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs is recognised for driving on French territory during the period in which the special residence permit is valid." Most, if not all, U.S. CERN users living in France hold a "Titre de sejour special", or special residence permit.

FYI #64:_ Science Committee Hearing on FY2010 Request**  
  
FYI  
The American Institute of Physics Bulletin of Science Policy News  
Number 64: May 15, 2009  
Web version: [http://www.aip.org/fyi/2009/064.html](http://www.aip.org/fyi/2009/064.html)  
  
Science Committee Responds Favorably to FY 2010 S&T Request  
  
Yesterday's hearing of the House Science and Technology Committee  
provided a first indication of congressional reaction to the Obama  
Administration's FY 2010 request for science and technology  
budgets.   Office of Science and Technology Policy Director John  
Holdren was the sole witness, and was praised by committee members  
on both sides of the dais.  
  
This one hour, twenty minute hearing was the first of several  
hearings on the request.  It afforded Holdren an opportunity to  
outline the Administration's positions on S&T funding and policy,  
and for Members to highlight their areas of interest.  
  
Funding is always a concern, which Chairman Bart Gordon (D-TN)  
addressed in his opening remarks when he said "we are facing tough  
budget times and we won't always have new money at hand."  Holdren  
addressed funding early in his own statement, telling committee  
members that an analysis of the FY 2009 and FY 2010 R&D budget  
numbers must include the funding in the American Recovery and  
Reinvestment Act  (ARRA) that was passed earlier this year and which  
will be spent in both years.  He also noted a requested increase in  
non-defense R&D FY 2010 funding and a proposed reduction in defense  
R&D spending.  Said Holdren: "With the estimated $13.3 billion in  
FY2009 dollars added by ARRA to the research funding for FY2009 and  
FY2010, and with Congressional approval of the President's proposal  
for the latter, these two years will provide the largest Federal  
investments in research in U.S. history. This follows four years of  
real decline in this category from FY2004 to FY2008."  
  
Holdren told the committee that the FY 2010 request "sustains the  
President's commitment to double the budgets for three key basic  
research agencies over a decade" as authorized in the America  
COMPETES Act for the National Science Foundation, DOE Office of  
Science, and the NIST laboratories.  Earlier,  Ranking Republican  
Member Ralph Hall (R-TX) praised  the Obama Administration for  
requesting this level of funding, citing "deep bipartisan support"  
for the COMPETES legislation.  Hall wondered, however, about the  
ability of the Administration to ensure that 3 percent of US GDP  
will be devoted to R&D.  
  
There was less agreement about NASA.  While the FY 2010 request  
would add almost a billion dollars to the agency's budget, in  
addition to a billion dollars in the ARRA, some Republican and  
Democratic members expressed reservations about the Administration's  
intentions.  Concerns were voiced about the time it has taken to  
select a new NASA administrator with Holdren telling the committee  
an announcement would soon be made.  Members asked about the  
Administration's plans for manned space flight missions, and the  
blue-ribbon panel to examine this program.  Holdren's written  
testimony addressed this: "As President Obama has emphasized on a  
number of occasions, he remains committed to U.S. participation in  
human as well as robotic space exploration, including sending  
astronauts beyond low-earth orbit."  His testimony then continued,  
"Reconciling these aspirations with NASA's other missions in an era  
of budget constraint remains a great challenge, however, and to help  
with it as we contemplate the budgets looking forward from FY2010 to  
the \`out years,' the Administration is establishing a blue-ribbon  
team of experts who will work closely with NASA to re-examine human  
space flight activities beyond the scheduled retirement of the Space  
Shuttle at the end of calendar 2010. The goal for the review, which  
will report to me and the NASA Administrator, is to be sure that all  
of the options for achieving as many of our human spaceflight goals  
as possible in this crucial period, consistent with also fulfilling  
NASA's other missions, have been identified and carefully analyzed."  
  
Other NASA questions concerned the feasibility of returning  
Americans to the moon by 2020, the Administration's "vision" for the  
agency, the five-year gap after the shuttle is retired for its  
replacement, the recent Russian announcement that it will charge $51  
million per seat for Soyuz return transportation to the space  
station, the problem of space debris, the entrance of China into  
space transportation, and future layoffs of NASA personnel.  The  
Administration's selection of Augustine to chair the NASA committee  
was praised by Ranking Member Hall; Holdren said that the other  
committee members that will be announced in the near future are also  
very praiseworthy.  
  
Holdren's answers to a wide range of other questions were  
well-received.  Members asked about  the protection of the world's  
oceans, funding for social sciences, international scientific  
cooperation, patent law reform, scientific integrity, the use of  
science in policy making, energy (fossil, biofuels, solar), DOE's  
proposed Energy Innovation Hubs, the NSF request for its Education  
and Human Resources Directorate, green buildings, energy storage  
technologies, the clean up of nuclear legacy waste, the funding  
formula for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, and avoiding  
the "boom and bust" cycle that has characterized science funding.  
  
This is the first of a number of hearings that will be held in  
coming months on the Administration's FY 2010 S&T request.  Next  
week, Science Committee members will have a chance to ask additional  
questions about one of their major topics of concern when the  
committee is scheduled to have a hearing on the FY 2010 NASA budget  
request.

Message from CERN Director General about Austrian participation in CERN  
  
_**

Dear Colleagues,

I would like to inform you of the actions taken by the President of Council and myself since we heard of the Austrian Science Minister’s wish to bring his country’s membership of CERN to an end. Both of us have written to the Austrian government setting out our belief that it is in Austria’s best interest to remain a Member State. I wrote to the Austrian Science Minister and the Austrian President as soon as I heard the news, while Professor Åkesson wrote to the Austrian Chancellor on 13th May, after having consulted with a number of Council delegations.

The delegations that Professor Åkesson has spoken to all expressed their surprise at the decision, and the way in which it was announced. They were also surprised that Austria should consider such a step at a time when we are poised to reap the rewards of a long period of investment in the LHC.

Such a step would not be in line with the general trend at a time when several countries are applying for membership of CERN. Just this year, Council had the pleasure of welcoming Romania to the CERN family for the first time. Four more countries have submitted their candidacy for membership.

At a time when the nature of particle physics is shifting from regional to global, with the LHC as its centrepiece, it is timely to take a close look at CERN’s role on the global stage. That is why Council has established a working group to look at the question of geographic and scientific enlargement of CERN, in other words, to examine the place that CERN should occupy in the global scientific landscape, as well as the conditions and categories of membership.

Furthermore, CERN was a pioneer of European research, and is an established flagship today. From the very earliest days, Austria has played an important role at CERN, with two Director-Generals coming from Austria, as well as one President and three Vice-Presidents of Council. Today, CERN is growing ever closer to the European Commission, each recognizing the other’s role in constructing a European Research Area. To this end, dedicated sessions of Council are being held to harmonize and strengthen national activities in the field and an agreement is about to be concluded between CERN and the European Commission.

Through its intergovernmental collaboration strategy, Europe is setting the standard for leadership and success in science. CERN is a prime example of this: a world-leader in its field, to which Austria has contributed fully. CERN’s successes are Austria’s successes, and in the 50th anniversary of Austrian accession to CERN, that is something to celebrate. Both the President of Council and I sincerely hope that Austria will reconsider its decision, and retain its place at the heart of science at CERN in line with the aforementioned European strategy.

This is what the Austrian government has been told. In parallel, there was a meeting in Vienna on Monday this week at which Felicitas Pauss and I met with Austria’s Science Minister. It was a constructive meeting at which we agreed to continue to work together in search of a common solution. Further follow-up meetings will be organised, the first of which takes place on Wednesday next week. At the same time, Professor Åkesson will continue his discussions with the Council delegations, and the two of us will keep each other fully briefed in preparation for the June session of Council, at which the question will be discussed. If there are any significant developments in the meantime, we will of course keep you informed.

Rolf Heuer

AAAS Policy Alert  
  
_**AAAS Policy Alert -- May 13, 2009   
  
Budget News  
FY 2010 Budget Proposals. On May 7, Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) Director John Holdren released the Obama Administration's FY 2010 R&D budget  
priorities through August 6. Appearing with Holdren in the AAAS Auditorium were NOAA Administrator Jane Lubchenco, NSF Acting Deputy Director Cora Marrett,  
and NASA Acting Administrator Chris Scolese, presenting the R&D budget outlooks for their respective agencies. According to OSTP's analysis, the Administration's budget requests for  
R&D in FY 2010 will total $147.6 billion, an increase of 0.4 percent compared to the FY 2009 estimate, excluding stimulus funding in the American Recovery and Reinvestment  
Act (ARRA).  
                     
Agencies slated for significant R&D increases over FY 2009 (not including ARRA funds) include NASA (with $11.4 billion of R&D requested, a 10 percent increase);  
National Science Foundation ($5.3 billion of  R&D requested, a 9.4 percent increase); National Institute of Standards and Technology ($637 million of R&D requested, a 15.8 percent increase); and  
Department of Education ($384 million of R&D requested, a 18.9 percent increase). The Department of Energy would see an increase of 1.1 percent for a  
total R&D portfolio of $10.74 billion, and the National Institutes of Health would grow 1.5 percent to $30.2 billion in R&D for FY 2010. Agencies that  
 would receive cuts in R&D include the Department of Defense ($79.7 billion  
, a 2.4 percent decrease), USDA ($2.3 billion, a 6.32 percent decrease), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ($644 million, an 8 p  
ercent decrease). Overall, non-defense R&D would increase 3.6 percent for a  
 total of $63.9 billion, whereas defense R&D would decline 2 percent to $83.8 billion. ARRA funds, which are meant to be spent over FY 2009 and FY 2010 are not included in these calculations.  
                     
On May 11 the Obama Administration released the full budget and analytical perspectives for the FY 2010 budget requests. The latter  
 includes a chapter on research and development (see Section 5 under "  
Crosscutting Programs"). AAAS will prepare a preliminary analysis of the FY 2010 budget requests for R&D and post it to the AAAS R&D Budget website soon.  
                     
Flu Spending Passes House Committee.  
The House Appropriations Committee last week approved a supplemental defense spending bill containing $2 billion for pandemic flu preparedness in response to the H1  
N1 ("swine flu") virus scare. The $1.5 billion requested by President Obama will go toward federal response efforts such as the development  
and purchase of vaccines, but the committee also added funds for state/local ($350 million) and international ($200 million) preparation and response  
efforts. This week the full House will consider the bill, while the Senate  
Appropriations Committee will mark up its version.  
                   
Other Congressional News  
  
Science Envoy Measure Advances.  
On May 5 the Senate Foreign Relations Committee unanimously approved legislation (S. 838) that would establish science envoys "to promote the advancement of science and technology throughout the world." Although th  
e bill does not explicitly define "science envoys," its sponsor, Sen. Richard Lugar (R-IN), said in a statement accompanying the bill's introduction, that "these envoys will be recogniz  
ed world leaders in their fields of expertise and will demonstrate that the United States is serious about engaging other nations in issues of mutual  
benefit and concern in science and research." The bill also allows the Secretary of State to establish or expand existing programs to increase the number of educational and cultural exchange activities involving the scie  
nce, medicine, research, and academic sectors.  
                 
Nominations  
                                
Margaret Hamburg, the nominee for commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration,  
 won endorsements from some key Senators during her nomination hearing before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which bodes  
well for her confirmation. At press time, votes on her confirmation by the  
committee and by the full Senate were not yet scheduled. Joshua Scharfstein  
 has been serving as acting FDA commissioner pending Hamburg's confirmation, but as Principal Deputy Commissioner and Chief Scientist, he is not subject to confirmation.  
                     
The Senate voted to confirm William Corr, former aide to then-Senator Tom Daschle (D-S  
D) and Rep. Henry Waxman (D-CA) to be Deputy Secretary of Health and Human  
Services.  
                     
Tara O'Toole, M.D., CEO of the Center for Biosecurity, University of Pittsburg Medical  
 Center, has been nominated to be Under Secretary for Science and Technology at the Department of Homeland Security.  
                    
                    
Executive Branch  
                     
OSTP Calls for Review of NASA Human Space Flight Program.  
At the May 7 budget rollout, OSTP Director John Holdren also announced the launch of an independent review to assess current and future plans for NASA's Human Space Flight initiatives and to present alternatives and options for ini  
tiatives that NASA could undertake after the Shuttle is retired in 2010. The review will be conducted by a blue-ribbon panel to be led by former Lockheed Martin CEO Norman Augustine.  
                     
                  
EPA Examines Biofuels.  
As part of a proposed rule implementing a renewable fuels production mandate from the 2007 Energy Bill, EPA released a  
 lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions analysis that includes direct greenhouse gas emissions from biofuels as well as indirect impacts of land use chang  
e from biofuel production. EPA's assessment, open for 60 days for public comment, presents greenhouse gas reductions of various biofuels under differe  
nt time horizons. On the day of the announcement, Secretary of Energy Steven Chu announced that$786 million in stimulus funding will be allocated to advanced biofuels and expansion of com  
mercial biorefineries.  
                     
Follow-Up: Public Consultation on Lab Biosecurity.  
Last week's Policy Alert (May 6, 2009) referred to a public consultation being held May 13-14 on an interagency review of laws and regulations  
related to laboratory biosecurity, and provided a link for advance registration and the program agenda. AAAS is submitting comments. For those interested, written comments must be received prior to May 18. 
                     
Elsewhere  
                     
Anti-Evolution Bill Dead in Florida. Florida's legislative session came to a close on  
 May 1, and with it the prospects of a bill that would have required teachers to present a "critical analysis" of evolution. This year's anti-evolution bill seemed to have significantly less momentum than the so-cal  
led "academic freedom" bill from last year (which ultimately failed as well).                      
                     
AAAS Report on Biosafety Training.  
On May 6 the AAAS Center for Science, Technology and  
Security Policy and the Program on Scientific Freedom, Responsibility and Law released a workshop report,  
Biological Safety Training as a Component of Personnel Reliability. The report addresses biosafety training for researchers working in high-containment laboratories, the process by which  
scientists are approved for access to high-containment laboratories, and the  
need for reporting of potential exposures.  
                     
European Parliament Votes on Animal Research.  
The European Parliament has voted to back the use of non-human primates in research, a move that pleased many science advocacy groups worried about a more  
stringent proposal last year that would have essentially banned the research. The revised policy would, however, still ban most testing on great apes  
including chimpanzees. Last week's vote was not the final one—that will likely come this year after next month's European parliamentary elections.

DOE Office of Science in the FY2010 Proposal  
  
_**

```
Dear Colleagues, Additional information on the President's proposed FY2010 budget forthe DOE Office of Science can be found at: http://www.cfo.doe.gov/budget/10budget/Content/Volumes/Volume4.pdf HEP starts at: http://www.cfo.doe.gov/budget/10budget/Content/Volumes/Volume4.pdf#page=231 The ILC budget request in FY2010 remains the same as in FY2009, namely $35M.  Details can be found at: http://www.cfo.doe.gov/budget/10budget/Content/Volumes/Volume4.pdf#page=268 It is not clear to me whether detector R&D is to be included in this amount, since there is a separate section on Detector Development on the next page with the following comments: "Current areas of investigation include R&D on detector technologies that couldbe used to pursue new opportunities in future lepton colliders,... A diverse programwill be continued, including efforts on particle flow calorimeters, very low-mass trackers, ..."

_AIP FYI #55: FY2010 S&T Request to Congress**

```
FYIThe American Institute of Physics Bulletin of Science Policy NewsNumber 55: May 8, 2009Web version: http://www.aip.org/fyi/2009/055.htmlAdministration Sends FY 2010 Request to CongressThe Obama Administration sent its FY 2010 budget request to CapitolHill yesterday.  At a noon time briefing, OSTP Director John Holdrenreviewed the science and technology components of the request, andtold the audience, "we have done better that almost any otherconstituency."  He went on to say "we have a President who gets it,"and who is "walking the walk," despite the US  being in a "very badspell economically . . . [in an] "era of stringency."Getting a firm handle on the FY 2010 request for science andtechnology programs is somewhat a work in progress.   Holdrenexplained that the Administration is still calculating how thebillions of dollars for S&T programs in the economic stimulus orrecovery act will be spent in this and coming fiscal years.  Theimpact of the stimulus funding is, in effect, to provide funding forFY 2010 spending in advance of the enactment of the traditional FY 2010appropriations bills (see http://www.aip.org/fyi/2009/016.html.)As was true in previous budget requests, the Obama Administration isalso noting the impact that congressionally-directed or earmarkedfunding has in analyzing its budget request.  For instance, an OSTPdocument shows that the NIST laboratories would receive a 1.2percent  budget increase in FY 2010. A footnote then explains,"2010 request is a 14.2 percent  increase excluding congressionalgrants and projects in 2009."OSTP has a ten-page document "A Renewed Commitment to Science andTechnology - Federal R&D, Technology, and STEM Education in the 2010Budget" available at http://ostp.gov/cs/rd_budgets as well as foursupplemental exhibits.  This FYI includes excerpts from the longerdocument.  Future FYIs will provide information from department andagency budget materials of interest to the physics, astronomy, andSTEM communities."The President's Fiscal Year (FY) 2010 Budget proposes $147.6billion for the Federal investment in research and development(R&D). That is $555 million or 0.4 percent more than the 2009enacted level. . . .  In 2009, 2009 enacted appropriations andpreliminary allocations of Recovery Act funding increase the FederalR&D investment to a record $165.4 billion; Recovery Act funds willbe spent in 2009 and 2010. . . . In real terms, the 2009 enactedlevel and 2010 Budget are among the two largest R&D investments inhistory. . . .  These investments, spread across two dozen Federaldepartments and independent agencies, reflect the Administration'srecognition that science, technology, and innovation are criticaltools for making progress toward the national goals of a prosperouseconomy, a clean energy future, a healthy American people, and astrong and secure America. The Federal R&D investment alsorecognizes that the urge to probe more deeply into the unknown andexpand the frontiers of human knowledge is at the core of theAmerican experience."BASIC AND APPLIED RESEARCH FUNDING:"The 2010 Budget includes a special emphasis on basic and appliedresearch to fundamentally improve our understanding of nature,revolutionize key fields of science, and foster radically newtechnologies. The Federal research portfolio (comprising basic andapplied research) totals $59.0 billion in the 2010 Budget . . . , up$376 million or 0.6 percent compared to the 2009 enacted level(excluding Recovery Act funding). After four years of decline inreal terms . . . from 2004 to 2008, the 2009 enacted level and 2010Budget represent a real dollar turnaround in Federal researchinvestments across the spectrum of the sciences and engineering."DEVELOPMENT FUNDING:"The 2010 Budget provides $84.1 billion in development funding. TheRecovery Act and 2009 enacted appropriations provide unprecedentedFederal support for R&D facilities and capital equipment totaling$8.2 billion . . .  , including support for the construction andrenovation of laboratory facilities at government laboratories,contractor-operated national laboratories, and academic institutionsas well as competitively awarded funding for the purchase of majorresearch instrumentation. In the 2010 Budget, R&D facilities andcapital equipment funding totals $4.5 billion, including substantialsupport from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration(NASA; $2.4 billion) for scientific facilities including theInternational Space Station and the Department of Energy (DOE; $1.2billion) for a suite of scientific user facilities at DOElaboratories."THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN FOR SCIENCE AND INNOVATION:The Bush Administration called its S&T funding doubling plan theAmerican Competitiveness Initiative.  The House leadership had asimilar plan called the Innovation Agenda.  The Obama Administrationwill continue the effort to double funding for the Department ofEnergy's Office of Science (DOE SC), the National ScienceFoundation, and the National Institute of Standards andTechnologies  Laboratories, calling it "The President's Plan forScience and Innovation."Page 4 of the OSTP document has an exhibit on the Administration'splan for "Doubling Funding for Key Basic Research Agencies in the2010 Budget," that is accompanied by a figure charting the doublingof basic research funding from FY 2006 to FY 2016. A selection fromthis page follows:"The President's Plan for Science and Innovation and the AmericaCOMPETES Act have identified NSF, DOE SC, and NIST as key to ournation's prosperity and to preserving America's place as the worldleader in science and technology. Although the previousAdministration voiced support for efforts to double these agencies'budgets between 2006 and 2016, these efforts fell short in 2007 and2008. In 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and the2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act signed by President Obama finallyput these agencies back on a doubling trajectory. The 2010 Budgetbuilds on these early Administration accomplishments with arequested $12.6 billion total for NSF, DOE SC, and the NIST labs, anincrease of $731 million or 6.1 percent above the 2009 enacted total(excluding Recovery Act funds of $5.2 billion for the threeagencies). These substantial increases keep the agencies on trackfor the fourth year of a ten-year doubling trajectory. In addition,the 2010 Budget establishes projections laying out a clear path tocompleting the doubling effort in 2016 with $19.5 billion for thethree agencies, double the $9.7 billion they received in 2006.Between 2009 and 2016, the Obama Administration's enacted andproposed budgets would add $42.6 billion to the 2008 budgets forthese basic research agencies, with a special emphasis onencouraging high-risk, high-return research and supportingresearchers at the beginning of their careers."The OSTP document identifies four "key R&D priorities": Investing inthe Sciences for a Prosperous America," "A Clean Energy Future,""Healthy Lives for All Americans," and "A  Safe and Secure America."The document also provides summary information on three multi-agencyresearch initiatives:Networking and Information Technology R&D: The Administrationrequested an increase of 1.l percent or $44 million to $3.9 billion.Nanotechnology R&D: The Administration requested a reduction of 1.0percent or $17million to $1.6 million, citing "the proposedelimination of 2009 Department of Defense congressional projects in2010."Climate Change R&D: The Administration requested an increase of 2.3percent or $46 million to $2.0 billion.

_The White House OSTP wants your opinion  
  
From ScienceDebate.org:** 

Barack Obama pledged to Science Debate that he would "[restore the science integrity of government and restore transparency of decision-making](http://www.sciencedebate2008.com/www/index.php?id=42#12)..."

He has referred to this pledge several times since, most recently in his speech to the National Academies of Science.  On March 9, the president formally asked the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) to make recommendations on how the executive branch can meet this pledge.  
   
The OSTP has opened a **public comment period** regarding this directive, giving you the opportunity to share your thoughts on what the next steps should be.  Comments are due by **Wednesday, May 13**.  
   
The OSTP is looking for recommendations on the six issues President Obama identified in his memo:

1. hiring and keeping qualified scientists
2. defining new policies to ensure integrity
3. using "well-established scientific processes" like peer review
4. disclosing scientific findings
5. ensuring that principles of scientific integrity are being adhered to
6. adopting additional policies like whistleblower protections

The OSTP is accepting comments via email and through their blog, [here.](http://blog.ostp.gov/)

Their original request for input can be found [here](http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2009/pdf/E9-9307.pdf) (pdf).  
   
Many organizations in Washington will be giving their opinions of what the OSTP plan should entail.  We believe it is important for scientists and other science supporters to be included in that process, and for you to indicate to the White House how science and scientific integrity affect your work, your families, and your communities.  
   
If you're interested in more background information, visit the scientific integrity site of our friends at the Union of Concerned Scientists [here](http://www.ucsusa.org/scientific_integrity/solutions/big_picture_solutions/ostp-public-comment.html).

**AAAS S&T Policy Forum**

Record Crowd Hears Holdren, Chu, Congressional Leaders Address Forum. Despite the lack of a proposed budget for the coming fiscal year - analysis of which has been a focus of previous Forums - Presidential Science Adviser and OSTP Director John Holdren's [opening keynote address](http://www.info-aaas.org/util/link.jsp?e=59NjMrf6iykdcnOKJtJ8yVx0KK2_LITMSZe2gMHFBt0c-visg9ck170L-cpbDLn_n&s=8xRo1EmCpdfNNECFo6Hc2sA..A&v=9NyiitCLY2cPuAd1AOrPwOQ..A) to the 34th Annual AAAS Forum on S&T Policy, April 30, was warmly received by the more than 600 attendees. Holdren outlined Administration S&T priorities, discussed the tasks and challenges facing OSTP, and asserted that the U.S. must become a world leader in addressing global climate change. [Several speakers](http://www.info-aaas.org/util/link.jsp?e=47YNycyl_p6XJlMxZ4G3rDzMe0MA0Yi1gTvSMG7hIJATNeMDk&s=8xRo1EmCpdfNNECFo6Hc2sA..A&v=9NyiitCLY2cPuAd1AOrPwOQ..A) noted that despite the current influx of federal funds for R&D, serious budget pressures lie ahead.  
  
Other notable speakers at the Forum included Secretary of Energy Steven Chu (who [outlined](http://www.info-aaas.org/util/link.jsp?e=3HAdVkrSLcAEJ1VfAFh0qQB5On3h5yio-jcu7FGKoncFXEEEP&s=8xRo1EmCpdfNNECFo6Hc2sA..A&v=9NyiitCLY2cPuAd1AOrPwOQ..A) how the federal government was responding to energy challenges), Chairman Bart Gordon (D-TN) of the House Science & Technology Committee, MIT President Susan Hockfield, Canadian Minister of State (Science & Technology) Gary Goodyear, Richard Garwin (who gave the Carey Lecture), and Rep. Brian Baird (D-WA), chairman of the House Subcommittee on Energy & Environment.

**Budget News**

According to [Office of Management and Budget Director Peter Orszag's blog](http://www.info-aaas.org/util/link.jsp?e=1G-ss0UhsXlo-1AQMl4hlCDH-ygg-Gar5FcdjR1RpbRTqEmFi&s=8xRo1EmCpdfNNECFo6Hc2sA..A&v=9NyiitCLY2cPuAd1AOrPwOQ..A) (released late May 4), the President's proposed budget for FY 2010 will soon be released in two phases: on May 7, the budgets for most agencies – the "micro view" – will be released (as well as a volume of proposed "terminations, reductions, and savings"); and next week, the cross-agency summaries and historical trends, including OSTP's R&D budget overview – the "macro view" – will be presented. Last week the [House](http://www.info-aaas.org/util/link.jsp?e=0-jkh8dWkT3n-qkJdT6KB-x1pYjq52-eOhP3bpM0OixoSdh-0&s=8xRo1EmCpdfNNECFo6Hc2sA..A&v=9NyiitCLY2cPuAd1AOrPwOQ..A) and [Senate](http://www.info-aaas.org/util/link.jsp?e=9hkWtoeqjSJbw-2wNomQH2c6uCGEggPCg71GCGxn9GO9RYU-qB10LBq0Y6fAZqY8n&s=8xRo1EmCpdfNNECFo6Hc2sA..A&v=9NyiitCLY2cPuAd1AOrPwOQ..A) approved the congressional budget resolution for the coming year based on the outline released by the Administration in February. The next task will be for appropriators to determine how the total $1.086 trillion budget outlined in the resolution will be divided among the 12 appropriation subcommittees. This week, the House Appropriations Committee is scheduled to mark up the $83.4 billion supplemental request for the Department of Defense FY 2009 budget plus an additional $1.5 billion requested by the Administration last week for the flu pandemic. The Senate Appropriations Committee is expected to follow suit next week.

**_**Serious accident at a work site on the CERN Prévessin site**  
  

This afternoon a fatal accident occurred during work being carried out by a company mandated by the _Communauté des communes du Pays de Gex_ on installations that pass through CERN’s Prévessin site. One of the workmen was found unconscious in an access shaft to the underground drains. He was immediately transported to the Geneva Cantonal Hospital, where he later died. The causes of the accident are not yet known.

The work forms part of the substantial project to renovate the used water treatment system of the Pays de Gex.

Independently of any measures taken by the competent authorities, I have set up a fact-finding group to establish the circumstances of the accident. CERN has suspended the work on its site until this enquiry reaches its conclusions.

Our thoughts are with the family and friends of the deceased.

FYI - The American Institute of Physics Bulletin of Science Policy News  
Number 53: May 1, 2009  
Web version: http://www.aip.org/fyi/2009/053.html

**  
  
Office of Science and Technology Policy Director John Holdren  
delivered the keynote address yesterday at the 34th annual AAAS  
Forum on Science and Technology Policy.  Holdren's address, and that  
of House Science and Technology Committee Chairman Bart Gordon  
(D-TN) which followed, were optimistic about the outlook for science  
in the Obama Administration.  
  
"Our biggest asset: the President's engagement with S&T," concluded  
Holdren's final slide.  "This is a president who just lights up,"  
Holdren said, "when the subject is science and technology," later  
adding, "this is why we are going to get this done."  
  
Holdren started his presentation with a review of the two major  
responsibilities of the Office of Science and Technology Policy and  
his position as the Assistant to the President for Science and  
Technology.  The first, to provide "science and technology for  
policy" which Holdren described as "independent, objective advice  
for the President and Vice President about S&T germane to all policy  
issues."  The second, "policy for science and technology,"  
consisting of  "analysis, recommendations, and coordination . . . on  
R&D budgets and related policies" such as STEM education, workforce  
issues, scientific integrity, and related matters.  
  
Assisting Holdren will be four Associate Directors, and a staff of  
sixty employees.  Many will be detailees from the National Science  
Foundation, NASA, NOAA, the Department of Energy, and the Department  
of Defense.  OSTP has an annual budget of about $6 million.  
  
Holdren will co-chair the President's Council of Advisors on Science  
and Technology with Eric Lander and Harold Varmus.  On Monday, the  
White House announced PCAST members; see www.ostp.gov.  Holdren will  
also co-chair, with President Obama, the National Science and  
Technology Council, described as a "Cabinet-level Council \[that\] is  
the principal means within the executive branch to coordinate  
science and technology policy across the diverse entities that make  
up the Federal research and development enterprise."  See the NSTC  
website at [http://www.ostp.gov/cs/nstc](http://www.ostp.gov/cs/nstc)  
  
Holdren identified five major applied challenges, including S&T for  
the economy, public health, energy, environment, and national and  
homeland security.  The "foundations of success" to meet these  
challenges include the U.S. capability for fundamental research,  
STEM education, information and communications technology, space  
capabilities, and supporting policies in areas such as intellectual  
property, scientific integrity, and visas.  
  
The Obama Administration has moved quickly on several major  
scientific and technological initiatives.  These include the  
President's announcement on allocating 3 percent of the nation's GDP  
to R&D (see [http://www.aip.org/fyi/2009/049.html](http://www.aip.org/fyi/2009/049.html) ), significant S&T  
funding in the economic stimulus package  
([http://www.aip.org/fyi/2009/016.html)](http://www.aip.org/fyi/2009/016.html%29), the preliminary FY 2010  
budget request ([http://www.aip.org/fyi/2009/025.html](http://www.aip.org/fyi/2009/025.html) ), initiatives  
in STEM education, clean energy and climate, health, stem-cell  
guidelines, and scientific integrity (see  
[http://www.aip.org/fyi/2009/028.html](http://www.aip.org/fyi/2009/028.html) ), and appointments.  All of  
this is set, Holdren said, in an "exceedingly demanding budget  
situation."  
  
In response to questions from the audience, Holdren said that  
"voices are being heard" regarding climate change in the  
Administration. The "policy challenge" is the major factor in  
deliberations about how green house gases should be controlled, he  
said.  In response to another question, he agreed that metrics for  
science programs should be more than just the funding provided.  
When asked if NASA should be included in those agencies for which  
the  budget is doubled, Holdren replied that fundamental science  
funding for the agency should be strengthened.  He predicted that  
the Administration will succeed in dealing with Congress, and will  
work to avoid the boom and bust funding cycle that has characterized  
previous science agency budgeting.  
  
Chairman Gordon's remarks built on those of Holdren.  He recounted a  
conversation with President Obama in which the President said, "I'm  
a science guy." Gordon told the forum that science funding must be  
spent wisely, later saying that the case must be made that "science  
is about jobs."  The science community must "put a face on it" he  
advised, so that the public sees science as being about more than  
just scientists.  "A lot of the future has to do with you," Gordon  
exclaimed.

****DOE Science Positions Move Forward**  
**

**FYI - The American Institute of Physics Bulletin of Science Policy News  
Number 52: May 1, 2009  
Web version: [http://www.aip.org/fyi/2009/052.html](http://www.aip.org/fyi/2009/052.html)  
  
**On April 23, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee held  
an afternoon hearing to consider five nominees for senior positions  
at the Department of Energy and the Department of Interior. Among  
the nominees was Steven E. Koonin to be the Under Secretary for  
Science at the Department of Energy. The hearing went smoothly, with  
limited questioning of each nominee.  President Obama has also  
nominated William Brinkman to be the Director of the DOE Office of  
Science.  Brinkman, now a Senior Research Physicist at Princeton  
University, will appear before the committee in coming weeks.  
  
In the Bush Administration, Ray Orbach was "dual-hatted," filling  
both DOE positions. Orbach started his service as the Director of  
the Office of Science. After legislation was passed establishing the  
new Under Secretary for Science position, Orbach also held that  
position.  
  
Committee chairman Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) opened the hearing by saying  
"I believe the president has chosen well," later exclaiming "I  
support each of your nominations."  Bingaman declared that he was  
"very impressed with the scientific credentials" of Koonin, who has  
served as Chief Scientist at BP for the last five years. Previously,  
Koonin was a professor of Theoretical Physics years at the  
California Institute of Technology and then its provost for nine  
years  
  
Koonin prepared brief written testimony which included his  
observations on the department's major activities. Selections from  
this testimony follow:  
  
"The basic research supported by the Office of Science is one of the  
jewels of the Federal research portfolio. The long tradition of  
peer-reviewed support for university and national laboratory  
researchers and forefront user facilities continues to drive  
advances on many fronts. We are on the cusp of understanding the  
origin of mass, the nature of most of what's in the universe, and  
how quarks and gluons combine to form nuclei. New instrumentation  
and new information technologies are enabling better understanding  
of the changing climate and new capabilities to predict, manipulate,  
and control materials, biological systems, and plasma. The  
commitments from Congress and the Administration to double support  
for these activities over the next decade are more than justified.  
  
"In nuclear security, the President has set ambitious goals for  
reducing the US stockpile of weapons while maintaining confidence in  
their safety, security, and reliability in the absence of nuclear  
testing. But these will not be achievable without a robust technical  
enterprise in the NNSA. The National Nuclear Security  
Administration's ongoing Stockpile Stewardship program of  
simulation, non-nuclear experimentation, and warhead surveillance  
and refurbishment has been effective for more than a decade, but  
faces growing challenges in maintaining technical capabilities.  
Strengthening these capabilities will be essential to achieving the  
President's non-proliferation goals.  
  
"In Energy, President Obama has set ambitious goals to enhance  
energy security and reduce GHG \[green house gas\] emissions while  
creating new jobs. Improvements in the technologies to produce,  
transmit, store, and use energy are essential to meeting these  
goals. But the scale, duration, cost, and complexity of energy  
matters pose great challenges. Technical understanding and judgement  
are important to making the right decisions about which technologies  
to pursue and how each should be advanced from research and  
development through demonstration and deployment. Novel forms of  
public/private and international partnerships will be required to  
address these global problems. I have pledged to Secretary Chu to  
work closely with the Under Secretary of Energy on these matters, I  
am confident that Dr. \[Kristina\] Johnson \[the nominee for Under  
Secretary of Energy\] and I will work well together, should we both  
be confirmed.  
  
"What might I aspire to accomplish in the position to which I've  
been nominated? As you know, by statue the Under Secretary for  
Science has the dual responsibilities of overseeing the basic  
research carried out in the Office of Science, and of serving as the  
principal scientific advisor to the Secretary. In the former  
capacity, I would look forward to working with this Committee,  
Secretary Chu, the Director of the Office of Science, and the  
broader scientific community to see that the existing and planned  
incremental funds for basic research are wisely allocated and the  
programs well-executed. In the latter capacity, I would hope to  
coordinate and harmonize technical activities across the department,  
looking for gaps and identifying synergies, bringing the rigor of  
appropriate peer review, program and project management to all parts  
of DOE. Indeed, the tone Secretary Chu has already set, and the team  
he is assembling, are highly conducive to achieving those goals. I  
would also hope to promote thorough and unbiased technical  
assessments in all matters facing the Department, as these  
necessarily underpin all good policy decisions."  
  
Senators were allocated time to ask questions to all five nominees.  
Among the questions Koonin was asked concerned the collaboration and  
coordination of the units within the Department of Energy on the  
very complex issues of energy and climate change. Koonin  
acknowledged the importance of doing so, describing energy as a  
unique issue since it affects so many people, adding that "change  
will only happen if, as we do the science and technology, we pay  
attention to the economic, political and social dimensions."  
  
Koonin's nomination was reported out of the committee yesterday, and  
is now pending before the full Senate.
