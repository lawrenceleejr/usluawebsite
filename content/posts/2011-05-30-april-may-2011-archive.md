##### AAAS Policy Alert

AAAS's preliminary analysis of R&D in the recently enacted FY 2011 continuing resolution indicates that non-defense R&D was spared the worst of the $38.5 billion in cuts.

##### AAAS Policy Alert

The FY2011 full-year continuing resolution was signed by President Obama on Friday, April 15, six and one-half months after the fiscal year began.  It includes $38.5 billion in spending cuts from FY2010 levels. R&D-intensive programs and agencies were spared the worst of the reductions. Basic research programs fared best, while applied research programs, especially at the Department of Energy, did less well, reflecting the current policy debates.

Visit the [AAAS R&D Budget and Policy Program Website](http://www.aaas.org/spp/rd/presentations/?elq=423e27cb9b81409483f985f7f1b9272e) to stay up-to-date on the latest action on the FY 2011 and FY 2012 budgets.

##### Good News on Science Budgets

From the AAAS web site:

[http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2011/04/research-survives-in-2011-budget.html?ref=ra](http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2011/04/research-survives-in-2011-budget.html?ref=ra)

Whew. That's what officials at U.S. science agencies and science lobbyists are saying this morning after learning the details of the weekend agreement between the White House and Congress on funding the government for the rest of 2011. The House of Representatives is expected to vote on the measure tomorrow, followed by the Senate on Thursday.

The agreement on a final continuing resolution (CR) for 2011 does take a $38.5 billion cut out of the $1.089 trillion spent in 2010 on discretionary programs across the federal government. That's an "unprecedented" cut, crows the chair of the House Appropriations Committee, Representative Harold Rogers (R-KY).

But it's also much less than scientists feared when the House passed its version of the CR in February, known as H.R. 1.

"We dodged a bullet," says Michael Lubell, a lobbyist for the American Physical Society in Washington, D.C. As Rogers's counterpart, Senator Daniel Inouye (D-HI), explains in a statement today, "The bill preserved critical programs that were targeted for cuts in H.R. 1, including ... vital scientific and medical research."

For the National Institutes of Health, the final agreement means a cut of roughly 1% from its current $31 billion budget. The National Science Foundation takes a similar 1% hit, to $6.8 billion. Both faced much larger cuts in the House bill.

The Department of Energy's Office of Science really made out well. Instead of a 20% reduction, its $4.9 billion program is reduced by only $35 million. And its fledgling Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy gets an annual appropriation of $180 million, its first, rather than $50 million in the House bill.

##### Invitation to join the APS Forum on International Physics

If you are a member of the American Physical Society, I'd like to invite you to join the Forum on International Physics (FIP). We deal with a wide range of international issues of interest to the LHC community, covering everything from international collaboration to equal opportunity and human rights, and electronic access to APS meetings. Working with the APS Office of International Affairs, and other units including DPF and the Forum on Physics and Society, we have been working to increase opportunities for APS members working or living overseas to attend meetings, collaborate with colleagues in the US and abroad.

More information on FIP is available at [http://www.aps.org/units/fip/index.cfm](http://www.aps.org/units/fip/index.cfm), including how to join online. Remember that the first two forums are free, that each additional one is $ 8 per year, and there is an online discount for joining.

You can get a feeling for the activities of the Forum by having a look at our March 2011 Newsletter  
[http://www.aps.org/units/fip/newsletters/201103/index.cfm](http://www.aps.org/units/fip/newsletters/201103/index.cfm) (the next issue will come out this Fall).

##### Forum on International Physics

The Forum on International Physics is a voluntary association of APS members who are interested in advancing the knowledge of physics and its diffusion by fostering cooperation and communication among physicists of all countries. The FIP organizes focused sessions at APS meetings, receives nominations for APS fellowships and the Wheatley Award, and communicates with its members via this page and a periodic Newsletter. The FIP also cooperates with several other APS bodies in charge of international scientific affairs. But the unique strength of the FIP lies in the openness of its agenda, which reflects the grass-roots origin of this Forum. Programs such as international book exchanges, equipment exchanges, travel grants, etc. have been established in the past as a result of individual initiatives of FIP members. So if you feel that something is missing in the area of international scientific cooperation, join the FIP and make it happen! And if you are already a member of the FIP, share the excitement with your colleagues and help us recruit even more volunteers!

Budget News

Appropriations Update

The current continuing resolution (CR) expires at the end of this week, April 8, and Congress is moving slowly toward a compromise for FY 2011 funding. Although the two sides appear to have tentatively agreed on an overall figure for total discretionary spending ($1.055 trillion) that is $33 billion less than current spending levels, there seems to be no clear consensus on what specific cuts to make to get to that spending level. In addition, there are a number of contentious policy issues that House Republicans would like to address in the resulting spending bill that have yet to be worked out, including funding for implementing the health care and financial reform bills and EPA’s regulation of greenhouse gas emissions. There is little support for yet another short-term CR unless it were to be for just a couple of days to finalize an agreement. This leaves negotiators only a few more days to reach a compromise and prevent a government shutdown.

House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-WI) releases his FY 2012 budget proposal on April 5. Over the past weekend, he revealed that his budget plan will cut $4 trillion in spending over the next 10 years and include both tax and entitlement reform. The plan will propose lower tax rates, but with a broader tax base (by eliminating some special-interest tax breaks) to maintain current revenue levels. Medicare and Medicaid reform will be included in the plan, with proposals to transition Medicare to a voucher system to allow seniors to choose between a variety of private insurance plans, and to change Medicaid to a block-grant system to give states more flexibility in how they utilize those funds. Although certain to attract considerable controversy, the proposal will likely serve as a counter marker to the Administration’s FY 2012 budget proposals as Congress considers appropriations for the coming year.

AAAS to Hold Congressional Briefing on R&D Budget. On April 7 the AAAS Office of Government Relations will host a congressional briefing on the "Outlook for Federal Research and Development." The briefing, to be held the day before the current CR is set to expire, is organized in conjunction with the House Research and Development Caucus.

University and Industry Leaders Call for Entitlement Reform. Last week the presidents of the Association of American Universities, Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, National Academy of Engineering, Council on Competitiveness, Business Roundtable, and retired Lockheed Martin CEO Norman Augustine sent a letter to the President and congressional leaders, stating that reducing the national debt cannot focus solely in decreasing discretionary spending and that national leaders should attend to entitlement reform as a critical element for reducing the deficit.

Visit the AAAS R&D Budget and Policy Program Website to stay up-to-date on the latest action on the FY 2011 and FY 2012 budgets, and to register for the annual AAAS Forum on Science & Technology Policy, May 5-6 at the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center in Washington, DC.
