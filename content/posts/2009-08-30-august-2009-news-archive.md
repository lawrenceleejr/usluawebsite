**Information wanted regarding tax professionals**  

Greetings,  

It's well known that there is some confusion among members of the U.S. community at CERN regarding income tax issues. In the hopes of assisting the community in some way with our tax needs, I am creating a list of tax professionals that are qualified to help people working for U.S. institutions at CERN.

I am asking for your help with this list. If you:

a. work for a U.S. institution

b. have ever spent enough time at CERN to fall under the "International Taxpayer" rules from the IRS ([http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/international/index.html](http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/international/index.html)), and

c. have employed a tax professional to provide advice or filing assistance with your taxes (in the U.S., France or Switzerland)

please consider sending me the professional's contact information. Minimum information I will need is:

\- name of the tax advisor/firm

\- phone number and email address

\- location.

Additional information that would be useful is:

\- which country they can file taxes in (U.S., Switzerland, France)

\- information about fees or fee structure (hourly rate, flat fee, etc.).

Please note that this list will not contain any endorsements of particular tax professionals, but will simply list contact information and other relevant objective criteria, so that other U.S. LHC users can find a professional in their area that will be able to help with their tax needs.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

Regards,

[Katie Yurkewicz](mailto:katie@fnal.gov)

**_**FYI #104: FY 2011 S&T Priorities Memorandum  
  
**The American Institute of Physics Bulletin of Science Policy News  
Number 104: August 10, 2009  
Web version: http://www.aip.org/fyi/2009/104.html  
  
White House Memo on FY 2011 Science and Technology Priorities  
  
Although completion of the FY 2010 budget cycle will require many  
hours of deliberations and negotiations on Capitol Hill, activities  
are all ready underway on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue on  
the FY 2011 budget.  This budget request will be released in  
February and will provide funding beyond October 1, 2010. 
  
It has become a fairly common practice for the Office of Management  
and Budget and the Office of Science and Technology Policy to issue  
a memorandum to the heads of executive departments and agencies  
describing science and technology priorities in the next budget  
request.  The Bush Administration issued these memorandums, and now  
the Obama Administration has done so.  
  
This August 4 memorandum differs somewhat from those issued during  
the last Administration.  (In 2008, the Administration did not  
require the submission of a formal budget request since President  
Bush was leaving the White House after the completion of his second  
term.)  One of the differences between the memorandum just released  
and those issued in 2006 and 2007 are the references the earlier  
documents made to the doubling of the budgets for the Department of  
Energy's Office of Science, National Science Foundation, and the  
National Institutes of Standards and Technology.  Also, in 2007  
these agencies were specifically referred to, as was the Defense  
Department's basic research program.  The new memorandum does not  
refer to any agencies by name, or to numerical targets.  Further  
information on the 2006 and 2007 memorandums can be found at  
http://www.aip.org/fyi/2007/089.html  
  
The new memorandum includes this guidance in the second paragraph:  
  
"In preparing FY 2011 Budget submissions to the Office of Management  
and Budget, agencies should build on the science and technology  
priorities already reflected in the American Recovery and  
Reinvestment Act and the FY 2010 Budget."  
  
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act provided billions of  
dollars for science programs.  The Department of Energy received $2  
billion for the Office of Science and the Advanced Research Projects  
Agency - Energy.  NASA's science programs were allocated $400  
million.  The National Science Foundation received $3 billion, and  
NIST $220 million for its Scientific and Technical Research and  
Services.  NIH saw a $10 billion increase (see  
http://www.aip.org/fyi/2009/016.html .)  The Obama Administration  
requested significant increases in the FY 2010 budgets of the DOE  
Office of Science, NSF, and NIST's research programs, among others.  
(For more, see http://www.aip.org/gov/budginfo.html .)  
  
The new memorandum speaks of redirecting, as appropriate, resources  
"to science and technology activities that address four practical  
challenges" in areas such as economic recovery and growth, reducing  
energy imports and mitigating climate change, improving health while  
reducing health costs, and national security.  OMB and OSTP are  
interested in increasing research productivity, improving STEM  
education, vital infrastructure, and "enhancing our capabilities in  
space."  There is also guidance on program evaluation, agency  
collaboration with "many players, at all stages," and better  
communication with the public. "Finally, agencies are expected to  
conduct programs in accordance with the highest standards of ethical  
and scientific integrity and to have clear principles, guidelines,  
and policies on issues such as scientific openness, scientific  
misconduct, conflicts of interest, protection of privacy, and the  
appropriate treatment of human subjects," the document concludes.

THE WHITE HOUSE  
WASHINGTON  
  
August 4, 2009  
  
M-09-27  
  
MEMORANDUM FOR THE HEADS OF EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES  
  
FROM:  
  
Peter R. Orszag  
Director, Office of Management and Budget  
  
John P. Holdren  
Director, Office of Science and Technology Policy  
  
SUBJECT:  
  
Science and Technology Priorities for the FY 2011 Budget  
  
Scientific discovery and technological innovation are major engines  
of increasing productivity and are indispensable for promoting  
economic growth, safeguarding the environment, improving the health  
of the population and safeguarding our national security in the  
technologically-driven 21st century. To this end, the Administration  
is already investing in: high-risk, high-payoff research; making  
permanent the Research and Experimentation tax credit; targeting  
investment in promising clean energy technologies research;  
improving health outcomes while lowering costs; and nurturing a  
scientifically literate population as well as a world-class, diverse  
science, technology, engineering, and mathematics workforce.  
  
In preparing FY 2011 Budget submissions to the Office of Management  
and Budget, agencies should build on the science and technology  
priorities already reflected in the American Recovery and  
Reinvestment Act and the FY 2010 Budget. This memorandum also  
provides general guidance for the conduct of science and technology  
activities in Executive Departments and Agencies.  
  
Prioritizing key science and technology activities \[Bold Font\]  
  
Agencies should explain in their budget submissions how they will  
redirect available resources, as appropriate, from lower-priority  
areas to science and technology activities that address four  
practical challenges and strengthen four cross-cutting areas that  
underlie success in addressing all of them.  
  
The four practical challenges are:  
  
Applying science and technology strategies to drive economic  
recovery, job creation, and  
economic growth;  
  
Promoting innovative energy technologies to reduce dependence on  
energy imports and mitigate the impact of climate-change while  
creating green jobs and new businesses;  
  
Applying biomedical science and information technology to help  
Americans live longer, healthier lives while reducing health care  
costs; and  
  
Assuring we have the technologies needed to protect our troops,  
citizens, and national interests, including those needed to verify  
arms control and nonproliferation agreements essential to our  
security.  
  
Addressing these challenges will require:  
  
Increasing the productivity of our research institutions, including  
our research universities and major public and private laboratories  
and research centers;  
  
Strengthening science, technology, engineering, and mathematics  
education at every level, from pre-college to post-graduate to  
lifelong learning;  
  
Improving and protecting our information, communication, and  
transportation infrastructure, which is essential to our commerce,  
science, and security alike; and  
  
Enhancing our capabilities in space, which are essential for  
communications, geopositioning, intelligence gathering, Earth  
observation, and national defense, as well for increasing our  
understanding of the universe and our place in it.  
  
General Science and Technology Program Guidance \[Bold Font\]  
  
In their budget submissions, agencies should describe the expected  
outcomes from their research in relation to these four practical  
challenges and cross-cutting areas, providing quantitative metrics  
where possible, and describe how they plan to evaluate the success  
of various techniques to increase support for high-risk research.  
  
Budget submissions should also describe how agencies are  
strengthening their capacity to rigorously evaluate their programs  
to determine what has been demonstrated to work and what has not.  
Budget submissions should show how such assessments allowed agencies  
to eliminate or reduce funding for less-effective, lower-quality, or  
lower-priority programs in 2011, and how they will be applied in the  
future.  
  
Agency budget submissions should also explain how the agency plans  
to take advantage of today's open innovation model-in which the  
whole chain from research to application does not have to take place  
within a single lab, agency or firm - and become highly open to  
ideas from many players, at all stages. Agencies should empower  
their scientists to have ongoing contact with people who know what's  
involved in making and using things, from cost and competitive  
factors to the many practical constraints and opportunities that can  
arise when turning ideas into reality. Agencies should pursue  
transformational solutions to the Nation's practical challenges, and  
budget submissions should therefore explain how agencies will  
provide support for long-term, visionary thinkers proposing  
high-risk, high-payoff research.  
  
Building on the unprecedented transparency and openness required for  
Recovery Act spending, agencies have a responsibility to explain how  
Federal science and technology investments contribute to increased  
economic productivity and progress, new energy technologies,  
improved health outcomes and other national goals. In order to  
facilitate these efforts, Federal agencies, in cooperation with the  
Office and Science and Technology Policy and the Office of  
Management and Budget, should develop datasets to better document  
Federal science and technology investments and to make these data  
open to the public in accessible, useful formats.  
  
Agencies should develop outcome-oriented goals for their science and  
technology activities, establish procedures and timelines for  
evaluating the performance of these activities, and target  
investments toward high-performing programs. Agencies should develop  
"science of science policy" tools that can improve management of  
their research and development portfolios and better assess the  
impact of their science and technology investments. Sound science  
should inform policy decisions, and agencies should invest in  
relevant science and technology as appropriate.  
  
Finally, agencies are expected to conduct programs in accordance  
with the highest standards of ethical and scientific integrity and  
to have clear principles, guidelines, and policies on issues such as  
scientific openness, scientific misconduct, conflicts of interest,  
protection of privacy, and the appropriate treatment of human  
subjects.

**_**LHC News**  
The LHC will run for the first part of the 2009-2010 run at 3.5 TeV per beam, with the energy rising later in the run. That’s the conclusion that we’ve just arrived at in a meeting involving the experiments, the machine people and the CERN management. We’ve selected 3.5 TeV because it allows the LHC operators to gain experience of running the machine safely while opening up a new discovery region for the experiments.  
   
The developments that have allowed us to get to this point are good progress in repairing the damage in sector 3-4 and the related consolidation work, and the conclusion of testing on the 10000 high-current electrical connections last week. With that milestone, every one of the connections has been tested and we now know exactly where we stand.  
   
The latest tests looked at the resistance of the copper stabilizer that surrounds the superconducting cable and carries current away in case of a quench. Many copper splices showing anomalously high resistance have been repaired already, and the tests on the final two sectors revealed no more outliers. That means that no more repairs are necessary for safe running this year and next.  
   
The procedure for the 2009 start-up will be to inject and capture beams in each direction, take collision data for a few shifts at the injection energy, and then commission the ramp to higher energy. The first high-energy data should be collected a few weeks after the first beam of 2009 is injected. The LHC will run at 3.5 TeV per beam until a significant data sample has been collected and the operations team has gained experience in running the machine. Thereafter, with the benefit of that experience, we’ll take the energy up towards 5 TeV per beam. At the end of 2010, we’ll run the LHC with lead-ions for the first time. After that, the LHC will shut down and we’ll get to work on moving the machine towards 7 TeV per beam._**

**_**Update on the flu pandemic (H1N1)**  
  
Message n° 4- 05 August 2009  
   
New strategy in the fight against the pandemic  
   
Since our last update, the flu pandemic (H1N1) 2009 has continued to spread throughout the world. Information from WHO on the epidemiological situation no longer allows them to accurately define the countries where the risk of infection is higher than in Switzerland. For this reason, the list of increased risk zones has been withdrawn.  Thus, anyone having been abroad should be considered as having been exposed to a higher risk than in Switzerland.  
The rapid evolution of the number of cases in Switzerland and in the surrounding countries as well as the characteristics of the pandemic virus (highly infectious and low virulence) have lead the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) to re-think the Swiss strategy in the fight against the pandemic.   
Now that the virus is present in Switzerland and affecting a growing number of people, the strategy has been reviewed in order to protect people against the increased risk of complications (young children, pregnant women, the elderly, or those being treated for chronic disease), in order to limit the death rate and to ensure that the local outbreaks are kept at a low level. There is no indication of drastic increase in the Geneva area and the best way to keep it like this is to maintain good basic hygiene.  
   
In concrete terms the measures taken are as follows:  
  
·         The test for diagnosis is no longer automatic.  Only serious cases of flu (rare) and patients susceptible to complications will be given a confirmation by means of a laboratory test and specific treatment with Oseltamivir (Tamiflu®).  
  
·         The systematic follow-up of contacts has been dropped in favour of targeted information via the attending doctor.  
  
·         Family doctors/General Practitioners: first point of call for treating patients: diagnosis, treatment and declaration of cases; identification and information to those in contact with patients.  
  
IMPORTANT:  
If you have flu symptoms, you are asked to make contact with your GP and NOT to go to the Accident and Emergency room.  
   
General measures to be taken by flu patients:  
   
Anyone with flu symptoms should act as though they are infected with the pandemic virus (H1N1) 2009:  
·         Stay at home until one day after you no longer have symptoms and maintain good hygiene measures (http://www.pandemia.ch/fr-ch/home.html) to avoid infecting others, in particular those with a higher risk of complications.  
  
·         Inform people that have been in close contact with you in order for them to keep an eye on their health and for them to maintain good hygiene.  
  
·         Do not go to work, do not go shopping, avoid public transport, do not attend demonstrations or go to creches, nurseries or schools, do not visit those with a higher risk of complications, do not visit patients in hospital or those in homes.  If possible, avoid close contact with those living under the same roof.  
  
·         Maintain good basic hygiene and wear a facemask when in unavoidable close contact with others.  
An anti-viral treatment should be considered if the symptoms are severe or are worsening or if the patient presents a high risk of complications.  
   
Today the FOPH does not recommend any travel restrictions in agreement with WHO.   For further information on individual protection please refer to ‘Travel’ on the WHO website: http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/frequently\_asked\_questions/travel/en/index.html.
