CALL FOR PROPOSALS: INDIA-U.S. TRAVEL GRANTS**  
  
The Indo-U.S. Science and Technology Forum (IUSSTF) and the American  
Physical Society (APS) have a program to sponsor the exchange of  
physicists and physics graduate students between India and the United  
States.

The PROFESSORSHIP AWARDS IN PHYSICS funds physicists in India or the  
United States wishing to visit overseas to teach short courses or  
provide a physics lecture series delivered at a U.S. or Indian  
university. Awards are up to U.S. $4,000.

Through the PHYSICS STUDENT VISITATION PROGRAM, U.S. and Indian  
graduate students may apply for travel funds of U.S. $3,000 to pursue  
opportunities in physics. The travel funds could be used to attend a  
short-course or summer institute, to work temporarily in a laboratory,  
or for another opportunity that the student and the host professor  
believes is worthy of support. The Physics Student Visitation Program  
aims to mostly support graduate student travel to India by U.S.  
citizens, while enabling some students of Indian citizenship to travel  
to the United States.

Further details about both programs, including proposal guidelines, are  
provided at:  www.aps.org/programs/international/us-india-travel.cfm.

THE UPCOMING DEADLINE HAS BEEN EXTENDED TO APRIL 30, 2010

CERN: LHC sets new record - accelerates beam to 3.5 TeV**

Source: CERN  
Content: Press Release  
Date Issued: 19 March 2010

Geneva, 19 March 2010. At just after 5:20 this morning, two 3.5 TeV proton  
beams successfully circulated in the Large Hadron Collider for the first  
time. This is the highest energy yet achieved in a particle accelerator,  
and an important step on the way to the start of the LHC research  
programme. The first attempt to collide beams at 7 TeV (3.5 TeV per beam)  
will follow on a date to be announced in the near future.

"Getting the beams to 3.5 TeV is testimony to the soundness of the LHCs  
overall design, and the improvements we've made since the breakdown in  
September 2008," explained CERN\*'s Director for Accelerators and  
Technology, Steve Myers. "And it's a great credit to the patience and  
dedication of the LHC team."

The current LHC run began on 20 November 2009, with the first circulating  
beam at 0.45 TeV.  Milestones were quick to follow, with twin circulating  
beams established by 23 November and a world record beam energy of 1.18  
TeV being set on 30 November. By the time the LHC switched off for 2009 on  
16 December, another record had been set with collisions recorded at 2.36  
TeV and significant quantities of data recorded. Over the 2009 part of the  
run, each of the LHCs four major experiments, ALICE, ATLAS, CMS and LHCb  
recorded over a million particle collisions, which were distributed  
smoothly for analysis around the world on the LHC computing grid. The  
first physics papers were soon to follow.

After the 2.36 TeV collisions, a technical stop ensued at the beginning of  
2010, during which the machine was prepared for higher-energy running.  
Higher energy collisions require higher electrical currents in the LHC  
magnet circuits. This places more exacting demands on the new machine  
protection systems, which have now been readied for the task.

Once 7 TeV collisions have been established, the plan is to run  
continuously for a period of 18-24 months, with a short technical stop at  
the end of 2010. This will bring enough data across all the potential  
discovery areas to firmly establish the LHC as the worlds foremost  
facility for high-energy particle physics.

AAAS Policy Alert: Budget News**

On February 24 John P. Holdren, Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) testified before both the House Science and Technology Committee and the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, and Science. Holdren's testimony before the [S&T Committee](http://www.members-aaas.org/l.jsp?d=3874.448534.654.4vdsleS55),

an authorizing body that does not appropriate funds for programs, provided an overall picture of the President's budget proposals for R&D in FY 2011. Committee Chair Bart Gordon was supportive of the general shape of the proposals, although several committee members had [pointed questions](http://www.members-aaas.org/l.jsp?d=3874.448533.654.4vdsleS55)

ICFA SCIC Reports for 2010**

The ICFA SCIC Reports for 2010, fulfilling the SCIC's charge, including an overview of recent developments in HEP networking and R&E networks worldwide, recent technology developments, and digital divide issues, and the global and  regional  
network monitoring results from the SCIC Monitoring WG are available at:

[http://monalisa.caltech.edu:8080/Slides/Public/SCICReports2010Final/](http://monalisa.caltech.edu:8080/Slides/Public/SCICReports2010Final/)

The documentation includes the main report on Networking in HEP, and 43 Annexes on national, continental and transoceanic R&E networks, as well as advanced network projects. The Network Monitoring Report presented by Les Cottrell and Umar Kalim is also available.

The presentation of the reports was well-received by ICFA. An extended set of slides (V10) is available at the above website which also includes current  information from other sources on:   (1)  the evolution of worldwide Internet usage, (2) access to broadband  
by region, (3)  the evolution of both transatlantic and transpacific network usage, installed and lit capacity, and the resulting projections of when capacity will be exhausted except for a transition to 40G and 100G links.

Each file is stored in more than one format for convenience.

We would like to thank all the contributors to the Annexes, and to the  other authors and editors  
of the main report (Artur Barczyk, Azher Mughal, Ramiro Voicu, Sandor Rozsa and Michael Thomas of the Caltech team) and the monitoring report (Cottrell and Kalim) for their work in making this information available to our community, and to the world at large.

Comments and suggestions for future reports are welcome.
