# Joining the USLUA Executive Committee

According to the USLUA constitution, we elect half of the executive committee to a two-year term each year. Elections will be announced on our mailing list. USLUA Executive committee members meet multiple times a year to discuss issues affecting US LHC Users and to coordinate USLUA activities.  As an executive committee member, you are expected to contribute to one or more of the eight subcommittees, and you are encouraged to participate in USLUA activities such as the Annual Meeting and DC Trip. Executive committee membership is a volunteer position. The time commitment varies individually, but you can expect to contribute a minimum of a few hours per month.
