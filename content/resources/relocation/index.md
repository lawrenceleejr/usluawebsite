# Relocation Guide for CERN

## Introduction

This page has been created for the US LHC Users Association by Tony Liss. It draws heavily on the extremely informative ATLAS “Coming to CERN” page created by Alexia Leyval. Thanks Alexia!

There are many other sources of helpful information. CERN has a comprehensive [Newcomers Guide](https://newcomersguide.web.cern.ch/).

Also another excellent website is the [Newcomer Welcome Center](http://newcomerwelcomecenter.weebly.com/). See also the [USCMS Twiki](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/Main/USCMSProjectOfficeCERN). Feedback and recent information are always welcome.


## Orientation to CERN

[Here is an orientation presentation](https://github.com/acostad/acostad.github.io/blob/main/NewStudentOrientationAtCERN.pdf) for members of your group who are moving to or visiting CERN. This is based on a presentation given regularly at Duke and modified by ACCU and USLUA Exec Committee member Darin Acosta. Please let us know if you have updates or corrections, as information changes, though we will try to keep the info here current.

## Visiting CERN – banking

For anyone visiting CERN short-term, as well as those in the process of moving here longer-term, there is a [useful comparison here](banking) (done in October 2011) about ATM cards, credit cards, fees, and exchange rates.

The [CERN Bulletin](http://cdsweb.cern.ch/journal/CERNBulletin/2010/38/Official%20News/1291960?ln=en) from 20 September 2010 describes the visa situation for CERN visitors.
