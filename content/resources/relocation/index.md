Also another excellent website is the [Newcomer Welcome Center](http://newcomerwelcomecenter.weebly.com/). See also the [USCMS Twiki](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/Main/USCMSProjectOfficeCERN). Feedback and recent information are always welcome.


## Orientation to CERN

[Here is an orientation presentation](https://github.com/acostad/acostad.github.io/blob/main/NewStudentOrientationAtCERN.pdf) for members of your group who are moving to or visiting CERN. This is based on a presentation given regularly at Duke and modified by ACCU and USLUA Exec Committee member Darin Acosta. Please let us know if you have updates or corrections, as information changes, though we will try to keep the info here current.
