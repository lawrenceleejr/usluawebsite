### Public Transportation

Public transportation around the Geneva area is excellent if you live relatively close to the city. Complete information on schedules, routes and how to get from point A to point B can be found on the [TPG website](http://www.tpg.ch/) and app. This includes all of the trams, busses, larger trains, and even the water taxis on the lake. A standard unireso pass gets you free movement within Zone 10 in a given timescale. Busses also connect the surrounding french area, including St Genis, Ferney, and Prevessin, but require a specific ticket since these are outside of Zone 10.

Single-ride tickets can be purchased at the machines at each stop. (Some of the French stops do not have a machine but tickets can be bought on board.) Yearly and monthly passes are available and can be purchased from the TPG office in the main train station Gare Cornavin or online. If you are at CERN short term and staying in a hotel in Switzerland, they can provide you with a free TPG pass for the duration of your stay.

The TPG app is useful for finding live timetables. The SBB/CFF app (the Swiss train network) also allows you to purchase TPG/unireso passes and supports Apple Pay and other modern online payment methods. This is likely the most convenient way to purchase a ticket.

Purchase a ticket **before** boarding the bus/tram. Most of the transit in Geneva works on an honor system, but they do checks. If they find that you quickly bought a ticket as the guards arrived, they will still give you a fine.

### Bikes and Scooters

For getting around CERN, there are bike and scooter shares. There is an app for your phone for reserving and operating these.

Longer term bike rentals are available at CERN. Talk to your group about how to rent such a bike.

### Cars

Recommendations are to rent a car in the country you will be staying to reduce problems crossing the border.

#### Obtaining a Car

**Rent a car in Switzerland**

At CERN: CERN cars with the CERN logo are no longer available unless you sublet one from a group. CERN cars are usually booked far in advance (three months), no obligation of a full-year rental. Hertz and/or SixT cars are also available at CERN (at a favorable rate, it is believed) by contacting the Transport Department.

You may also try [Patrick Location](http://www.patricklocation.ch/) for lower rates than the better-known companies. Hertz, Avis, SixT and Europcar are well known.

For a lease (17 days of more), one might check [Kemwel](http://www.kemwel.com/buyback_home.cfm).

**Rent a car in France**

**Ferney Voltaire**: Budget: 04 50 40 67 87, around 650 euros per month **Autohire**: 04 50 42 88 41 , 440 euros per month for more than 3 months **St Jean de Gonville**: Opel rent: 04 50 56 39 87, 600 euros per month for more than 6 months.

**Buy a car**

To buy a car you must first have your papers (Attestation de fonctions). You can buy a car with your US driver's license. If you buy from a dealer, they can take care of the insurance for you. [Comparis.ch](http://www.comparis.ch/comparis/default.aspx) is a useful website for comparing insurance costs.

To find a second hand go to CERN market: [http://consult.cern.ch/service/news/](http://consult.cern.ch/service/news/)

Check in Paruvendu.fr for France: [http://www.paruvendu.fr/html/bonjour/index.php](http://www.paruvendu.fr/html/bonjour/index.php)

Check in GHI.ch for Geneva: [http://ghi.ch/live/1/home/](http://ghi.ch/live/1/home/)

**Car share service**

In Switzerland there is a car share co-operative called [Mobility](http://www.mobility.ch/pages/index.cfm?dom=6).  Particularly if you live in Geneva, this can be an excellent alternative to owning or renting a car (or perhaps a second car). At least one USLUO family had a very good experience with convenience, quality of the cars, and the cost.

#### **Plates and Swiss Highway Sticker**

See  [http://humanresources.web.cern.ch/Humanresources/external/SOC/installation\_service.asp](http://humanresources.web.cern.ch/Humanresources/external/SOC/installation_service.asp),

**SWISS HIGHWAY TOLL Sticker/Vignette**  
Mandatory. Cars are required to have a window decal sticker on the vehicle in order to travel the Swiss Autobahn. Owners must contribute 40 Swiss Francs to the treasury for these decals, which are available at the border offices, post office and some other government places. Those decals are good from January through December. They still cost 40CHF even if you by it on December 30th. IF YOUR RENTAL CAR DOES NOT HAVE ONE, YOU'LL NEED TO BUY ONE.

#### **Driving License**

**In Switzerland**

[http://www.geneve.ch/san/permis-de-conduire-et-permis-d-eleve/welcome.asp?rubrique=echange-d-un-permis-de-conduire-etranger&titre=Echange\_d\_\_un\_permis\_de\_conduire\_etranger](http://www.geneve.ch/san/permis-de-conduire-et-permis-d-eleve/welcome.asp?rubrique=echange-d-un-permis-de-conduire-etranger&titre=Echange_d__un_permis_de_conduire_etranger)  
  
You can go to the DMV-equivalent to get a Swiss driver's license. As of 2017, if you present them with CERN paperwork, instead of forfeitting your american license in exchange for a swiss one, you actually get to keep both. The Swiss license you get may have no expiration date which is very useful for americans based at CERN long term. You will just need to get an eye exam (can be done at any glasses store e.g. at a mall), bring the correct photos of your face, and pay a fee (roughly 100 CHF).

**In France** 

For non EU citizens, any driving licence held by a person who is in possession of a special residence permit issued by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs is recognised for driving on French territory during the period in which the special residence permit is valid. Most, if not all, US CERN users living in France hold a "Titre de sejour special", or special residence permit.  A useful article on driving licenses with more information was published in a [December 2008 CERN Bulletin](http://cdsweb.cern.ch/journal/article?issue=01/2009&name=CERNBulletin&category=Official%20News&number=-1&ln=en).

This information is of special importance to holders of U.S. licenses issued by states that do not have a reciprocal agreement with France. (A list of states with reciprocal agreements from 2007 can be found here: [http://france.usembassy.gov/root/pdfs/paris-driving.pdf](http://france.usembassy.gov/root/pdfs/paris-driving.pdf))

#### **Car Insurance**

Compare prices at [Comparis.ch](http://www.comparis.ch/comparis/default.aspx).

**In France** If you live in France, you need to obtain your car insurance in France. You will need to get a 2 year certificate of "good driver" to get cheap prices.
