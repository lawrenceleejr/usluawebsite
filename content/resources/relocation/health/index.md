### Emergencies in France

If you have an accident or a health problem AT CERN, please contact  the infirmary immediately at **73802** or mobile phone **163438**. There you will see a doctor and he/she will call an ambulance if necessary.

If you can manage to see a doctor or even have an X-ray on your own, we strongly recommend that you go to France: St Genis Pouilly or Ferney Voltaire. It will cost you around 50 euros for leg X-ray and 22 euros for a visit to the doctor.

The cost in Switzerland is around 300 CHF for both X-ray and doctor visit at the Hospital de la Tour.

Be aware that you may have to pay the total amount of your bill before leaving the hospital in Switzerland, and the amount can be huge. The only insurance recognized by hospitals here are CIGNA and BLUE CROSS; for all the rest the patient will have to pay himself and be reimbursed by his insurance. For example, for an appendectomy, recently patients were asked to pay over 20 000 dollars before leaving the hospital! You must look into travel insurance not only to guarantee entry but also the ability to leave the hospital.

### **Health Insurance**

People usually choose to go with Uniqa which is around 460 CHF per month for coverage of 80% of the fees, with some exceptions. 920 CHF for less exceptions and for the entire family. NOTE for moving back to the US: Pay attention to the cancellation time frame! Uniqa may require 30 or 60 days notice, and they may be very inflexible about it. This can be costly and inconvenient for reactivating coverage in the US.

There may be an alternative carrier other than Uniqa. Check with the Users Office or your experiment secretariat.
